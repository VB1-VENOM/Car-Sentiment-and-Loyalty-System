0,1,B001E4KFG0,Good Quality Dog Food,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
1,2,B00813GRG4,Not as Advertised,"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo""."
2,3,B000LQOCH0,"""Delight"" says it all","This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch."
3,4,B000UA0QIQ,Cough Medicine,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.
4,5,B006K2ZZ7K,Great taffy,"Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal."
8,9,B000E7L2R4,Yay Barley,Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too
9,10,B00171APVA,Healthy Dog Food,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
10,11,B0001PB9FE,The Best Hot Sauce in the World,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!"
11,12,B0009XLVG0,"My cats LOVE this ""diet"" food better than their regular food","One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week."
13,14,B001GVISJM,fresh and greasy!,good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!
28,29,B00144C10S,YUMMY!,"I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!"
29,30,B0001PB9FY,The Best Hot Sauce in the World,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!"
30,31,B003F6UO7K,Great machine!,"I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)"
32,33,B001EO5QW8,Best of the Instant Oatmeals,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey."
51,52,B000G6RPMY,HOT!  And good!  Came back for more  :),"Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not ""burn your mouth forever hot""  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us.."
54,55,B002GWHC0G,Roasts up a smooth brew,"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively."
56,57,B004N5KULM,Awesome Deal!,Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.
62,63,B001EO5TPM,stale product.,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
63,64,B005DUM9UQ,Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!,"I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough."
68,69,B000E7VI7S,How much would you pay for a bag of chocolate pretzels?,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping)."
70,71,B001GVISJC,Great Gummi!,"These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!"
72,73,B006SQBRMA,Best ever latice tart,"I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed."
73,74,B0059WXJKM,Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
74,75,B001EPPI84,nothing special,It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again
76,77,B004X2KR36,Good,"These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up."
79,80,B005R8JE8O,this is the best,"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp."
80,81,B0066DMI6Y,Delicious!,This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!
82,83,B003ZFRKGO,Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!,"I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."
83,84,B0019CW0HE,Natural Balance Lamb and Rice,"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients."
100,101,B004K2IHUO,Taste wise it is a 6 star item,"The mouth says, ""How do I love thee, let me count the ways...""<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy."
107,108,B001REEG6C,Wasting Vinegar on a Cucumber is a Shame!,"I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!"
110,111,B000J0HIT2,Low Carb Angel Food Puffs,"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one."
111,112,B0037LW78C,Delicious tea,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.
116,117,B0026Y3YBK,Great cookies,"I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again."
118,119,B003SE19UK,So Far So Good,"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it."
127,128,B003OB0IB8,Tastes great. Love Hot & Spicy. Bad price here.,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart."
136,137,B002SRYRE8,Tastes awesome & looks beautiful,"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)"
140,141,B001GVISJW,Nice snack,I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.
145,146,B0017I8UME,Sweet with a nice kick!,"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!"
148,149,B0064KU9HO,Ehhh...,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
149,150,B0037ZFEW4,awesome cornmeal,"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor."
150,151,B00374XSVY,GREAT marinade!,"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!"
152,153,B005P0HHGK,tastes good,Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.
153,154,B002HQAXUW,Rip off Price,"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy."
154,155,B000SV90J8,JELL-O,AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.
156,157,B0036VM05I,Great Deal,What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
158,159,B000ITVLE2,tastes very fresh,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway."
165,166,B003TQQKFQ,This stuff is sooooo good!,"I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)"
167,168,B007B9J6G2,Very Low quality,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
168,169,B0064KO0BU,Not Banana Runts,"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor."
171,172,B001IUKD76,Ricore forever,"I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out."
173,174,B0081XN2HQ,"Fluffy, Soft, Delicious and Sugary Sweet","I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really ""takes the cake"" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"
174,175,B0025VRCJY,Great but not as good as it was back in the day as a teen,I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.
179,180,B005CJVVJ8,"relaxing, almost like something you smoke","Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff."
183,184,B001KUUNP6,Perfect for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies,"We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it."
186,187,B000NY8ODS,"Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful","This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."
187,188,B00029XIZI,Miracle,"My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It's tolerablel."
188,189,B004V6AH34,not bad for instant healthy coffee,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)"
193,194,B0028C44Z0,Great for after lunch,These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!
209,210,B0009XLVGA,"better than average, more expensive than average.","we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies."
214,215,B002TDK0VK,Best by the case,Don't buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.
217,218,B0040WAG7Q,More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand,"My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more."
218,219,B001EO5ZMO,Ahmad Loose Imperial Blend Tea is great for the price,"A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it."
225,226,B001SATU8E,DELICIOUS,"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.<br /><br />The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins."
226,227,B007JFV6RK,Best Bloody Mary mixer,"I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy."
229,230,B001L4ELRW,Not Good,This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
230,231,B003SO503C,Love this tea!,"I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long."
232,233,B003ZFXJDW,just give me some watermelon and citron sea salt,"i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience."
235,236,B001HTL6CY,"Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!","The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor."
236,237,B000WFRMRW,Eukanuba puppy small breed dog food,"This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock."
238,239,B001EO5ZME,Great tasting green tea and such a great deal.,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
239,240,B0093NIWVO,OMG best chocolate jelly belly,"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding."
240,241,B001EO5ZMY,Excellent loose tea.,"If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces."
246,247,B007TFONH0,Wonderful!,"I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?"
249,250,B000GGKQSO,keeps you out of the dentest chair,If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.
250,251,B007J32WX4,Super!  SuperFoods are Super easy!,"WOW!  This product is very impressive. I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!  I've just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  I'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon."
251,252,B0017129DC,Pok Chops,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
252,253,B0002567IW,Sad outcome,"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(."
253,254,B0048IC328,Best Energy Shot For Me,I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.
256,257,B0025WIAN0,"Yum, Yummy, Yummier","These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasn't sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.<br /><br />I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh."
257,258,B00821UN4M,Reeks like chemicals,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
259,260,B00473RWXY,Great for Gluten-free lifestyle!!,"Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value."
260,261,B002MV23XM,my dog loves these,"These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product."
262,263,B000LKZK7C,sugar in the raw,"I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much."
277,278,B001D07IPG,Excellent for G/F,"Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another ""binder"" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!"
283,284,B000H13270,Rotel saves me on a daily basis,"I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird ""tin can"" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product."
287,288,B001UJEN6C,Great Natural Energy,"This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results."
306,307,B003EMU7EU,could use only once,"I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)"
307,308,B0064KOUNI,VANILLA TOOTSIE ROLLS,"You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!"
308,309,B003YDP5PA,One of my Favoritte foods,"Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more."
312,313,B002X9JNYU,what quantity is it!,I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?
313,314,B001EPQ0J0,Very Good Coffee,"I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try."
316,317,B000O9Y62A,Hot!,"It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing."
318,319,B00283TPYE,Swiss Chalet,"service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)<br /><br />Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade"
319,320,B001FB69YY,Oyster Sauce,"Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again."
320,321,B004OYBN7C,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!,"These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional ""marzipan-aholic"" should enjoy these."
321,322,B000JEHAHS,Great gag gift,Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit.
325,326,B003VTN95K,coffee-mate coffee creamer hazelnut,i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.
331,332,B007DJ0O9I,AWFUL,"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth."
333,334,B00469VSJI,"Yes, this is real excellent coffee!!!","Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend."
336,337,B002SRAU80,The king of all seasoning salts.,"This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma."
337,338,B0067LDV66,Toasted Sesame oil,"The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!"
339,340,B000HKYP9A,"Love, Love, Love These!","Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
347,348,B00067AD4U,Great Beans!!!,I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!
351,352,B0029OWDAU,Love Love Love,"Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good,"
352,353,B000SEJ84M,The product is great but the price is out of line,"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices."
353,354,B001LMNXFA,Swedish Pearl is not the same as  Belgian Pearl,"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls."
355,356,B002J2DO8W,great taste,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
356,357,B000U9V5AU,Taste-tested by a wine maker,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."
357,358,B001SB099M,Excellent Everyday Olive Oil,"Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands ""out there"" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again."
358,359,B0041QJSJS,"Love Weavers, I am a fan.","I hadn't tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not it's my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far."
363,364,B00437JI8Q,GREAT SNACK,"I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.<br />It has everything that I am searching for in a, ""To Go Snack"".<br />Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!!"
368,369,B002O3VHXU,Price surprise,"""Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count)"
374,375,B0057FTBYO,Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup,"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont."
375,376,B0087HW5E2,Greatest Oil since slice bread !!!!!!!,"I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans."
376,377,B003YXWAF8,Best Ever!,"Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again."
382,383,B000UXA3L8,Porcini Mushrooms an excellent product,"I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA."
384,385,B004AVYUOW,The Best,"If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!!"
385,386,B001ESOQAM,Good for the money,"The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.<br /><br />My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.<br /><br />Great value for the price."
389,390,B001ESOQA2,Valentine gift winner,"I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol"
390,391,B003XT4AV0,Cat won't go near it!,"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!"
392,393,B001FA1MCO,Ham Base,This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor
394,395,B001ELL6O8,Delisious Pancakes,Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.
403,404,B006CGURWM,disappointing,"Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable."
404,405,B00250I0EG,Great Healthy Snack,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
405,406,B000C21OOM,Sweet and Soothing,"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."
406,407,B003D4O92K,minty flavor,"This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used."

410,411,B0089PI9OC,Excellent tea!,"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box."

415,416,B005WU7V00,VERY GOOD! Great taste and easy for a single guy!,"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!"
416,417,B005CFC9XY,An acquired taste!,"The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!"
417,418,B000SEJ842,Look elsewhere for your whole grains,"A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage."
418,419,B004X8TK8I,Hey!,Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!

639,640,B001EPPFGO,What a great tea at this price,"This is a delicious tea!<br /><br />I'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.<br /><br />The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.<br /><br />This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I don't add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2-3 minutes it's ready.<br /><br />Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick!"

649,650,B001EPPCNK,Do not taste from bottle! Mix with vanilla for true flavor.,"So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle, it tasted like smoky flavored milk - YUCK! I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch."
651,652,B002U56JXU,The oldest soft drink is still the best!,"I'm from Detroit, and I was raised on Vernor's ginger ale.  Once I moved to California, though, I found it difficult to find Vernor's.  It would pop up here and there, and then disappear.  I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!"
653,654,B002BCD2OG,"Caramel flavor, excellent for baking and toppings (tips for using agave, too)","If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications)."
673,674,B00112B9T2,Best tea I ever had,"I was out to dinner with friends & family at ""The Saloon"" in ""Rte 46 Entertainment Complex"" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had."
674,675,B000G6MBX2,That's a spicy!,"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff."

735,736,B001HTKZ5S,Perhaps something was wrong with the batch...,"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time."
742,743,B001BB3LW6,Dum Dums for all!!,I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!
744,745,B005Y0DXBO,"when you have no fridge but want meat, what do you do?","This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I don't eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild ""spam""-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason."

My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia. Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink, albeit at a lesser level.<br /><br />BTW: Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping."
747,748,B000QWXG9O,Annie's Homegrown Organic Whole Wheat Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese - 6 oz.,"This product is made by Annie's Inc. in Berkely, CA--made in the USA.  The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.<br /><br />The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.<br /><br />This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.<br /><br />This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.  There are 2.5 servings per box (2.5 oz).  Each serving contains 250 cal., 4.5 g fat, sat. 2 g fat, 10 mg cholest., 570 mg sodium, 43 g carb., 5 g fiber, 6 g sugars, 9 g protein.<br /><br />However, the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter, milk, or yogurt.  To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.<br /><br />The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor."

751,752,B0035YE9CS,"Good soy sauce, but not special. Mainly good as unique gift.","This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate."
760,761,B006JWQFC0,Amazingly true to flavors...,"I'm pleased with these- wasn't sure how they'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples, but figured Werther's was a good bet.  I'm diabetic, so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just can't happen as often as I'd like to do so.  But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can 'carb budget'  the real thing. These are made with sugar alcohols, so it's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you're going to be near home and have turbo-flush on your toilet.  (TMI???)  This pack of 6 will last a while, but they're definitely a 'will reorder'.  :)"

Nothing wrong with Whitman's, but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice.<br /><br />As a sampler, it provides only a few of the Milka options. Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.<br /><br />Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.<br /><br />I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Box.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com"

776,777,B001FKQQDO,Where are the cranberries?,Bought this at a local specialty-item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...I've had much better and that's just talking about the supermarket brands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.

He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.<br /><br />Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.<br /><br />We've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well."

Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these.

It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis.

The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."
842,843,B000UWSQT0,not creamy...,"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste."
847,848,B0041CKRJC,soda,being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
851,852,B0007NG568,"Excellent quality product, fast delivery...","The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)"
856,857,B000VKYKTG,awsome,"I looooove pocky, got once at lucky's and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.<br /><br />Great product, and great price from this merchant!"
872,873,B000HDMUQ2,Really wanted to like these...,"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The ""clusters"" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods."
892,893,B0041QIHC2,Fantastic Coffee!!  Best I've ever had,"My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas.  He told me that ""weaver"" was the original roaster for Pete's coffee, he eventually split off and started his own roaster.  Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious!  I've never been married to a brand of coffee, usually would buy the Starbucks 2.5 lb bag at Costco, or whatever looked good at Trader Joes, but Weavers is in a class of it's own.  I'm subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly.  TRY IT!!"
895,896,B001ELL9XG,Beautiful presentation ...and a pretty good tea too!,"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list."
898,899,B002DXZI40,I can't take the smell,"The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars.  However, I do have issues with the product, namely, me and my family members can't take the smell.  The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin.  This was a few weeks ago and though I've since changed my sheets, the scent is still in my bed.  Ultimately, I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like.  It smells like an Indian spice and while it didn't work for me, scent-wise, it may work fine with someone else."
899,900,B000ER6YO0,"Our twins love this one. With the subscription, the price is fair","Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult."
948,949,B003KDCJYY,Allday Energy,Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.
949,950,B000MTIYF2,The best!,"I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy."
950,951,B002E0RIHM,Tasty Fruit,Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!
953,954,B000S806VM,Sassafras Tea Bags,As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
963,964,B000YT5DBS,"These are good, but ...","These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or ""best by"" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has ""expired"", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the ""use by"" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice."
964,965,B005NEXK6Y,Great product!,"I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again."
967,968,B00448SNSA,OMG DO NOT BUY!!!,"OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star."
968,969,B0002XIB2Y,WONDERFUL gravy!,"This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don't use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!"
972,973,B000F0G75W,Eco sugar,"Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon."
973,974,B001EQ4DVQ,More expensive online,"I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all."
981,982,B004DTNJU2,new to rooibos tea,"I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I've read about."
984,985,B00473OV2E,The Best,"This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars..."
986,987,B0048IACB2,Great Tasting Diet Tea with all Natural Ingredients,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and<br />our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased<br />with the natural ingredients and no calories.
987,988,B006F2NYI2,Awesome Sauce,"This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce."
1000,1001,B004A8VV42,best babka,I never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good! This is the real babka! That my gram mother use to make
1001,1002,B002XG21MO,My dog loves these but....,"I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts."
1007,1008,B006GK4XVA,Smells like roses but no safety or freshness seal.,The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product.
1008,1009,B0049UVNYY,delicious truffle goodness!,"I was hoping these were more true caramels, not caramel-flavored truffles, but they're still delicious. Would definitely order them again, and maybe extra for gifts. The salt just makes them extra amazing.<br /><br />Bummer about the shipping-- shipping on this item is reasonable, but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time, and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box. There wasn't even anything fancy about the packaging!<br /><br />edit: okay, these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle. the package wasn't shipped with an ingredients list, and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well-hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover there's a lot of shady ingredients, including high fructose corn syrup. For $40 a box, I expect NO CORN SYRUP. I also don't expect propylene glycol (antifreeze) in vanilla, which I expect to be 100% vanilla beans, and NOT artificial vanillin (which sometimes comes from the anal glands of beavers). I'm disappointed in the ingredient quality.<br /><br />http://www.premiumchocolatiers.com/ingredient_info.php<br /><br />Review goes from 5 stars to 3. I'd make it 2, but the extra star is because they ARE quite delicious."
1009,1010,B0062KYM9C,a little too sweet,Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after
1010,1011,B0002MKFEM,Way too salty,"I tried this and I found it too salty.<br />Plus I ate this fish sauce with some fish but I realized it was kind of redundant.<br /><br />I'm kidding, of course. This stuff is great!"
1011,1012,B0040TPNO0,Warm and Wonderful,I don't usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey.
1012,1013,B0048IK8UC,Not good,The noodles in the box were all broken.  The sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor.  I threw out most of the skillet.  I would recommend not purchasing this product.
1013,1014,B000LRG11O,BEst stuff ever,"Cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1/4 vinager and 1/4 h2O, rest oil. good!"
1014,1015,B001E6KBSK,An ideal breakfast,"It's balanced, it's tasty, it's filling, it's good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?<br /><br />I still miss Kellogg's sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best."
1042,1043,B0017SRF52,Great Stuff,"Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker, wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor, what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didn't turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat, the jerky is great, but the ribs are outstanding, and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs, awesome deal."
1043,1044,B001HTKS1Y,Delicate Asian salad dressing...,"I try every Asian salad dressing I can find.<br />This is my favorite one for salads because of it's delicate taste.<br />My other favorite is ""Newman's Own, Low Fat Sesame Ginger"".<br />The ginger in Newman's gives it a stronger flavor which is great<br />as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes."
1046,1047,B000FL08PG,coffee beans,Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again.
1048,1049,B0018AMWES,Good product - better price elsewhere,"This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.<br /><br />However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1. Comes with Prime shipping too!"
1051,1052,B001TZSDJK,Totally Fantastic,"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon."
1053,1054,B000CQG862,Best Tea EVER!!,"I ordered the White Christmas, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the Christmas eve.  It's the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor, I use it for iced teas all year round.  I can honestly say that I never got into tea that much until I tried STASH teas.  I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father, and he called me to ask where I'd gotten it, because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife, too.  Once tried, you will be addicted. Visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles.  These make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies."
1056,1057,B001SAX7Z6,Great fat free and spicy!!!,"Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!"
1057,1058,B000XB80CG,Not exactly as described,I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store.
1058,1059,B001GCVLXG,Crumbled cookies are no fun to eat,"The Good:<br /><br />Walker shortbread cookies are my favorite, I love them.  I bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each.  If this were the end of it, a five star review.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the Walkers cookie company.  After UPS was through with the shipment, my cookies were reduced to crumbs.  I contacted Amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response.  Since I bought these ""Shipped and Sold by Amazon"", I won't be purchasing these cookies from Amazon again."
1064,1065,B0017ZBPTW,Worth the cost due to the unique flavor - my favorite sugar!,"Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.  Recommended!"
1068,1069,B001QXUTLU,"Superior product, GMO Free","Due to my husband's and son's inability to eat gluten, cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes.  I am very concerned with the prolific use of GMOs in corn especially and my family's increased consumption of it.  I wanted to find an affordable GMO free cornstarch product to use in all my baking.  Rumford Natural Cornstarch is the one!  I've been using it for months now with great success & satisfaction."
1070,1071,B004XDMS3C,melted!!!,Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe'.  :-(
1071,1072,B0043PU4VS,Very Potent.,"If you love garlic, I recommend this flavored oil.  It is true to its name.  I was not expecting it to be so strong, so if I use it for cooking or dipping bread, I will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future."
1072,1073,B001GE3T1G,"Hands Down, Best Mint EVER.","These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You won't regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them!"
1076,1077,B0035Q0N0I,Great Ingredients,"Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects."
1077,1078,B0028PDGQA,Great price-great quality.,"You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced ""organic"" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea."
1082,1083,B003UY9GTE,an excellent alternative to regular Gatorade,"Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a ""pre-diabetes"" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.<br /><br />G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />If you're on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade."
1083,1084,B006WVH7NE,Gold Plated Cereal,All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware!
1084,1085,B0030N5K1I,awful,"This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- 45lb dogs that will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, most of them spat it out after a few chews, left it there, this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives, these dogs will work for lettuce. Where is a zero star button?"
1088,1089,B004FD13RW,It is awesome.,"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
1091,1092,B0025ULYKI,"Good taste, just enough heat","These are identical to ""Jay's hot chips"" (are they made by the same company?).  They have a slightly sweet taste, with a nice bit of heat. Definately not overwhelming heat, on a heat scale of 1-5, I would give these about a 2.  Regarding the texture, these are not kettle cooked chips, so they do not have much crunch, they are comparable to regular Lays chips.  For about $1 a bag, they are a great deal."
1114,1115,B003UDV9SG,Good brand of food,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)"

1119,1120,B0028SWACS,Quality white tea with added unusual flavors,"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating."
1124,1125,B001KVLDBI,All cherry - I couldn't find it in stores.,"3 boxes, under $6 each for all cherry - great buy.  I couldn't find all cherry in the store and don't really care for the other flavors."

1128,1129,B003UDSXU8,jolokia salsa review,this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because it's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar... perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board.
1132,1133,B002OHOC6A,My cats love it,"My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well."
1143,1144,B002NVPPHC,i love candy,i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween.
1145,1146,B001ELL7JM,Non Alcoholic..,"This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.<br /><br />Going to buy again for sure."
1149,1150,B004SR97LO,"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great","Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit."
1150,1151,B004OHKJWE,Arrived broken and isn't eligible for return?,"I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.  I will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isn't in the future."
1151,1152,B0017WFN4S,Like tiny light flavored peanut halves....,"Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat."
1152,1153,B004134H9W,Items in this Gift Basket were bad -- old and stale,"Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say ""could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale.""  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible."
1158,1159,B007NWPB70,Just ok,This tea is a new flavor of black tea by Tazo. It's better than some other brands but not even close to beIng as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus (which they took off the market). I don't think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores.
1160,1161,B000084E1U,Cats love it!,"I have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles! The last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate, but I'll be buying them more of this..."
1161,1162,B003JNWQPC,Vendor ripped off all of their cultures from other vendors,This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.
1162,1163,B001DR488E,The BEST!!!!,I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce.
1163,1164,B004IF3TAQ,Perfect for hard licorice lovers!,"If you like soft licorice, these cats aren't for you.<br /><br />A perfect anise-y balance of salty and sweet, these little licorice kitties are perfect! You pop one (or several) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey.<br />Hard exterior. Lasts forever if you suck on them. Everlasting licorice Katjes!!<br /><br />Very fresh. Super fast shopping too. Thank you guys!"
1167,1168,B000IUOBMA,Must Have Been Spoiled,"This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing."

1176,1177,B00283V4GQ,False Advertising,"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers."
1194,1195,B000JWEEB0,Apple Cinnamon Muffins,"Anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring.  We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes....this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And...no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect!"
1197,1198,B005J4ZMR8,Marianne,"I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one."
1198,1199,B008L19ZQ0,Favorite thing about Brazil,"I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong."
1203,1204,B00845LR4G,Mini Mini is right!,"These are tiny packets. I bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not. My kids love the product, but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages. I sent them back."
1204,1205,B005O072PC,Yummy,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."
1232,1233,B006QFTT4Q,Big fan!,"I'm a big fan of Outburst Energy Bites, and the peanut ones are probably my favorite. They're reasonably priced and a great snack. Think of peanut M&M's and a coffee all at once. Since they taste so good, it is very tempting to eat the whole box. They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!<br /><br />I highly recommend these!"
1234,1235,B000K296BW,"Shipping by price, not weight?",a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price.<br />This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.
1236,1237,B002G8N4ZW,Great Product! This is REAL Garlic Juice!,"I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!"
1240,1241,B000OK7UDG,Delicious tea!!!,"I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadn't had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas."
1242,1243,B002483RNI,Maple Syrup,"Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything you'd like sweetened.<br />Delivery was timely and the product came as expected. I recommend this!"
1243,1244,B00002Z754,WOW Make your own 'slickers' !,"I just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product. We love &quot;slickers&quot; which is what we call them, instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily. My daughter designed signs to be  printed in reverse to use on her car windows. They printed beautifully (we  have 'The Print Shop' program). I am going to have a lot of fun with this  product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv  screens and computer monitors."
1245,1246,B001209QMU,Too good to be true.,"After years of drinking Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster and some others, I have found the holy grail of energy drinks. It kicks in within 2-3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day. After seven hours or so, you gradually come down. There is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off. You just get very sleepy when you finally rest.<br /><br />Redline Power Rush is the very best product on the market. If it were illegal I would buy it on the black market. 'Nuff said."
1246,1247,B001FA1L7K,perfect size!,"The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner)."
1249,1250,B004QXELMK,OMG! So Good!,Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Can't wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011.
1250,1251,B0045TK2ZK,Horrible!,"So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!"
1251,1252,B002T62G7S,Crab Cakes Delight,Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.

1256,1257,B001FA1L7A,Barb,Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.
1265,1266,B003O7A70Y,Makes excellent biryani,"I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.<br /><br />I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out."
1266,1267,B000LKZTSC,"Good tea, bad bag","I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesn't happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.<br /><br />Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. It's frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company."
1271,1272,B007237380,Absolutely the Best,"Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well."
1272,1273,B000WNJ73Q,"Healthy, non-fattening, just the right size and delicious!","I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!"
1294,1295,B002WJYCR4,Deeee-licious!,"OMG these things are delicious!@ I'm not a candy/sweets eater usually.. but ... OhMan! I liked them so much I may have had , two.. oops, now three!"
1295,1296,B001FA1L7U,u talked me into it  mr. beer nut,"I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well they're here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50's, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, they're pretty darn good."
1309,1310,B000FAMUO4,Yum,"This is the good stuff! I am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. This pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. It's colorful and tasty and is great ""al dente""."
1312,1313,B003MCEV0I,Expensive But Worth It!,"Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it!  I have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one.  Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.  You won't believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the table...worth every penny!"
1314,1315,B002ULEFYE,chocolot!,It's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  It's great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they don't arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates!
1315,1316,B00110GBII,Much better than milk chocolate!,We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL!
1317,1318,B004EKO2HE,"Warning: Reviews do not reflect actual product (Feb 19, 2012)","The current product, ""Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN"", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by ""Alive and Aware"", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr."

1330,1331,B00126EQBU,What bacon is supposed to be,"I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in ""store bacon"" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the ""good old days.""  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack."
1331,1332,B008MMLXEK,Delicous,"Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great."
1332,1333,B002TM37RU,DELICIOUS,"These are thin,crisp, fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. They are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. (my choices) If you like ginger snaps you will love Lars ginger snaps."
1336,1337,B000I5DJVE,Got a chest cold with a nasty cough?????,"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.<br /><br />I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.<br /><br />So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.<br /><br />So I'm stuck with 11 packs.<br /><br />See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them."
1342,1343,B000ODRY9I,Instant Favorite!,"This dressing became an instant favorite of mine.  It's fat free without losing the flavor.  Alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions, and that only makes you have to use twice as much.  Wish Bone is now my only choice for Ranch dressing.  My husband doesn't usually go for fat free or diet anything, but I put this on our salads and he didnt even know!"
1350,1351,B001JTCPE0,Delicious tea- slight hints of almond and chocolate but not overpowering,"This is a very smooth tea from Argo Tea.  I was so excited when they came to NYC, and I bought a bag of this tea to make at home.  It has an almondy/chocolatey flavor (but not overpowering).  It's a great tea for everyone, including people just starting to drink tea.  I love it in a Latte (I just microwave some milk and use that instead of water)."
1351,1352,B003Y0ZJUE,Great for multi-infusion.. Jasmine Dragon Pearl Green TEA,"If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great ."
1352,1353,B0046HFHD8,Darn Good!,We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
1354,1355,B005151BV6,Yummy!,"Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they aren't more readily available to purchase locally."

1366,1367,B0013JQON4,Another favorite!,"I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond."
1371,1372,B001HTN94C,"Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined","Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined, is a very mild oil. I can't detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all. Maybe that's what you want in some cases, though I was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts.<br /><br />It does have the advantage of having higher Omega 3 content than most oils. Also most oils that are high in Omega 3 (like fish oil and flax oil) have a strong taste which you probably don't want on your salad.<br /><br />Unlike some of Spectrum's oils, it is not organic."
1372,1373,B00068PCTU,White Stevia 12 Oz Pwdr,Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.

1421,1422,B005LURDB8,Smaller Than Expected,"Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7"" inches long and a little less than 1"" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-)"
1423,1424,B00061NJ06,Costa Rican Export Coffee,"We first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in Costa Rica while on vacation.  We bought a few bags and brought them back home with us.  Costa Rica grows arabica coffee beans, fantastic.  We enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning. It's strong, flavorful, full bodied, and not bitter.  In our 12 cup drip coffee maker, we use two rounded scoops (about 5 tbs).  When we finished the last of the coffee, we looked on Amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in Costa Rica.  We bought four bags and will be getting more."

I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them."

1439,1440,B001E50UEQ,It's Fast.  It's Food.,"Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK."
1449,1450,B003OB2EP6,The best around,"I'm not so sure why the other guy didn't like this so much, I LOVE IT!!  In fact, it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  It's tried and true, rarely cooks wrong, and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor, it's so good, why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before, bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time."
1456,1457,B006ZLAH4M,"So far, Donut Shop Classics are the best pods I've tried","I ordered this 13-pack sampler, and I have to say that I really do like the flavor of the Donut Shop Classics pods.  They are mellow, smooth, and have virtually no bitterness.  I just can't believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods.  I give them four stars because I prefer freshly roasted and ground, but to date, when I'm in a hurry in the mornings, which is most mornings, I reach for a pod of Donut Shop Classics."

1458,1459,B001EO7E2I,Yum,If you like garlic this is for you. I've been making this as a dip with Greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. I usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. I have gotten rave reviews from my friends. My only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out.
1459,1460,B0040WHJQM,YUM YUM!,"I've been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now, and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor."

I have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients, and this one is the best by far.  However, I will not order it from Amazon again.  I ordered a case, two different times, and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented.  The second order, the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open, the other 10 cans, were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  They need to package items better.  Amazon did issue a full refund, but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged, I am not willing to order soup, or any other food items from them."

After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!"

1497,1498,B002KGN4LE,Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]"
1503,1504,B003UIDAHY,Absolutely awesome!,"I love pasta, but it does not love me.  I just don't seem to be able to digest it.  But this pasta, not only tastes great, it is so easy to digest.  And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-)"
1517,1518,B001LQNX8S,I will never go back to Senseo pods as long as these are available.,"First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods."
1524,1525,B000E1HUEE,Great dessert,"This by far the best pudding mix, you don't see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most don't like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this..  Carl"
1527,1528,B0045TDE4Q,"Quick, Easy and Delicious","My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha White's Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic."
1532,1533,B000KM7DVC,Love it!!,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food."
1533,1534,B00116629A,Good but way too expensive,"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge."
1534,1535,B000E7WM0K,"Not bad, but it really is just a taste of thai","Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving."
1555,1556,B000E7WM0U,Yum!,"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies."
1561,1562,B0052BRVTK,House Blend is good coffee,"Different flavors for different people.  Not everyone is going to like this just as others, like me, will love this coffee.<br /><br />It's totally subjective.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.  I enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable, in my opinion.  It matches my local big box grocery store."
1562,1563,B001EU5S9S,my order,"I was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting.  It was fantastic.  I asked the server if they could get me the name of the company, but they were unable.  Thank goodness for Amazon I was able to find it.  It's the best I have had in many years.  It arrived on time and very securely packed."
1570,1571,B00443YFCS,product is great price is insane,Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!
1571,1572,B0009QWTMM,"Jittery, lacks body","I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
1572,1573,B001CWZXIY,High Quality My Dog Enjoys and My Budget Does Too!,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives."
1602,1603,B001RVFDOO,yummy,"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper.<br />Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count."
1907,1908,B005FG6KZ8,Soo GOOD!,"Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks,I mean who wouldn't like them? You can't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!"
1911,1912,B0016PKA1C,Found the solution on how to open it,"I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot)."
1934,1935,B000F4EU52,Inside of can corroded,"After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response."
1943,1944,B005ATI9EU,Okay but some weird flavors,"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?"
1944,1945,B001HBTGI8,So much easier!,"I'm a big fan of the Dirty Martini - but I simply can't eat enough olives to keep up!<br /><br />Love this stuff - Not quite as tangy as Dirty Sue, but still very vibrant."

1961,1962,B004H4R0YO,Great Cooking Oil !,"Love this Balance Blend of Oils , especially in mix batters such as : Pancake , Cornbread ,Cake , Etc... , a good oil to ingest !"
1962,1963,B001FQ0UEE,Yum,I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(<br />So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.<br /><br />I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good.<br />Also the tin is very cute.
1968,1969,B000X61Y60,"Great taste, less sodium","The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet."
1973,1974,B0017165OG,Pok Chops,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
1974,1975,B000OR0WFM,So yummy-wonderful inexpensive gift item!,"This is a fabulous gift! I ordered 3 and kept one to try-and they are awesome! The presentation is great, chocolates delicate, creamy, crunchy, and tasty, easy to eat, not heavy. For a mass produced line, this is a real winner. Better than most out there in its price range. Love the 3 different flavors. Will buy again. Great hostess gift."
1977,1978,B005HGAVGA,Great starting pack!,"I bought this as my first pack of K-cups, its definitely a good buy! Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!"
1983,1984,B003FA0M1O,"Teeny, Tiny Little Treats, But Good For What They Are, A Healthy Reward For Following Commands","We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."""
1986,1987,B000F52NU0,CAUTION!!!  ADDICTIVE CANDY&lt; VERY >,"I've never been addicted to candy.  In fact, I don't usually like candy with the occasional exception of Halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet.  But these little guys, watch out.  It might SEEM like a 12 pack is a lot, but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue.  A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ""Ahhh, that's it.""<br /><br />I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution."
1991,1992,B001E5E29A,This is great stuff,I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.<br /><br />Easy to make and very tasty.
2079,2080,B005HGAVGK,Very unsatisfied!,Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!
2094,2095,B003NRLKOM,Very Good Flavor,"I got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although Yuban is our everyday coffee. Well this was a surprise! Nice and flavorful, not bitter, smooth and maybe not as strong as Yuban in the same amounts the was all there. If they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price I would buy more but as is its very pricey."
2095,2096,B007POA176,They should say just add milk....,i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. haven't tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better!
2098,2099,B0001OINNQ,Perfect Gift,"This product was a gift to a far distant relative.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket.  I cannot attest to the food personally, but she loved it!"
2099,2100,B000EPP56U,Excellent rice crackers,"I always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter.  And since I also had discovered I was allergic to wheat, I wanted and needed an alternative.  I originally found these Kame Rice Crunch crackers in Kroger supermarkets.  From the first bite, I loved them, and I wished I had discovered them years ago.  The plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste, and they are perfectly crunchy and light.  I've occasionally had a hard time finding them, so I'm THRILLED that Amazon is now carrying them.  Give these a try, they are delicious!!"
2114,2115,B00061EXBU,Cheaper from Penta.com,I too have begun to drink only Penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water.  I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
2119,2120,B0064MEUS6,Don't waste your money,"The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care."
2120,2121,B000EGX2E6,Get's old too quickly!,"I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products, and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk, and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didn't have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok, not too sweet, but I found myself getting sick of it fast."
2122,2123,B0017OV6LA,Awesome Candy!!,I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too!
2123,2124,B003SQ9WHA,"Great product, poor packaging.","This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product."
2124,2125,B004ET9OIW,I don't know what I'd do without this...,"My 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if I'd let him. He LOVES these puffs! He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good, but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them. I obviously buy these in bulk. We've only tried the carrot/cheese... I think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but I will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack!"
2139,2140,B001HTG9VW,Very tasty - just the right amount of salt and fresh flavor!,"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.<br />I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.<br />Enjoy!"
2140,2141,B002BB7EWI,"Great invention, tasty, healthy","We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store."
2156,2157,B004K6781Y,Miam-Miam!!,"Well, maybe I'm the first one to review this wonderful treat, but I know I'm not the first one having tried them! This treat is so safe, healthy, and yummy! In my native language, Miam-Miam is for Yum-Yum!<br />There you go. Not too sweet, yet not lacking sweetness. You can't taste one ingredient above the other one (OK, besides the coconut, since it's mostly made of it), it's so good.<br /><br />This is a raw food product that has been dehydrated at low temps, it's really nice to give to our kids. (We have 7 of them, and they love it). Of course it's a bit more expensive than your average treats/candies, but hey, who wants to complain?<br /><br />Do you want crappy candies with dyes, chemicals and cooked (so basically poison), or you want to give REAL FOOD for yourself and your kids?<br /><br />I bet if people learn to do/prepare these treats and give that to their kids, school would be less filled with Asperger Syndromes, ADD, ADHD kids etc....<br /><br />This is a treat that you won't regret having spent money on it, unless of course... you are so used to the chemical loaded-pesticide-herbicide-overly cooked-High Fructose Corn Syrup-dyed candy, then it's not for you.<br /><br />Keep your money instead, you'll need it for the bills you'll have when you go to the numerous Docs that can't help you and your kids. Sorry....:("
2159,2160,B000N5XCPM,Half-empty cans and greasy inconsistent ingredients,"We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year.  Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans.  Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling?  We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.<br />  They need to start testing their food again.  It used to be great.  Look at the old reviews from last year and before."

2174,2175,B000LKTDNE,Great tea.,Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
2175,2176,B002SW7ZOW,Tastes very good!!!,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
2186,2187,B000QUZ9LO,Good 'ol Dubble Bubble Taste! :-),"You just can't beat the taste of the original Dubble Bubble Gumballs! It really doesn't matter that the taste only last a minute or so, but that is why I bought the tub! The  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in A+++ condition! If your longing for the classic taste go for it! You will not be dissappointed!"
2187,2188,B000EPP56K,Tasty but...,"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
2196,2197,B008YAXFWI,"Mild Taste, But Delicious.","A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
2197,2198,B001FPT2MG,Excellent taste,I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.
2198,2199,B000LRKO9E,Wonderful condiment,"The pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition.  I encountered this as an ingredient in a Mollie Katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint.  We thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue, and got many rave reviews from our guests, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike.  I recommend both the vendor and this item."
2205,2206,B002RKGEII,Excellent by itself or in hummus/baba ganoush,"Always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip - this brand of tahini I'd never tried before or seen in supermarkets, so I decided to order and try it....excellent by itself or in recipes! Highly recommended."
2211,2212,B0007T3V82,Nice!,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
2218,2219,B002C4HZ00,Best value for the genuine article IF you have PRIME,"There is much confusion about tomatoes, and shopping on-line in this case adds to the complexity.  These are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing.  The Strianese are hands down the best.  My local store sells them.  I have been using them for fifteen years.  But they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal.  No Prime shipping with them.  I use these specific Cento when I am not home.  It all depends on how much your sauce means to you.<br /><br />But you need to know what you are buying.  These Cento tomatoes are 1) San Marzano sauce tomatoes; 2) they are D.O.P. certified 3) and this point is often overlooked, they are from the Sarnese Nocerino.  They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.<br /><br />The price per can is good.  The best deal is if you have Amazon Prime and get regular shipments.  I get three large batches per case, enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day.<br /><br />Most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes, especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz ""fresh"" tomatoes at the supermarket.  But if you are a maestro, these are what you want."
2245,2246,B000ARTNR4,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies!,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.
2254,2255,B002WUQUIC,Great For Cakes,"While I have not purchased this from Amazon I have used it for many years.  It makes a super layer for, my version, of Zuppa Engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for Pate Choux.<br />I don't live in Hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to Amazon I find it it available and in larger cans.........  I plan to order soon.<br /><br />Gino Rossi<br />Mangia con passione chef/caterer"
2255,2256,B0000DC5IY,Don't buy this product unless you are looking for shredded coconut,"The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.<br /><br />Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.<br /><br />Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.<br /><br />If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"
2257,2258,B001HKZDYU,Excellent service from vendor!!!,"Although I had some concerns about product with initial shipment - my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent, prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns.  Customer service that seems a rarity these days - was absolutely exceptional!  Will definitely keep this vendor in mind when I have need for other craft supplies/products."
2258,2259,B003NZH3VS,Disappointing,"I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:<br /><br />(1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.<br /><br />(2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.<br /><br />(3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.<br /><br />(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.<br /><br />(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99."
2261,2262,B003HG6U3A,Por Kwan Chilli Paste w/ Sweet Basil Leaves Hits the Spot in Vegetarian Dishes,"I'm on my first jar of this, and am really enjoying what it adds to my ""concoctions"" - vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions, garlic, vegetables, usually tofu, rice or pasta or quinoa, sometimes olives or capers.<br />I may have purchased it at Uwajimaya, when on sale...I will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste.  It's not really a paste - more liquid, with easily identifiable basil leaves.  I highly recommend this chili paste."
2262,2263,B000E1HVF2,Great to keep on hand for desserts!,"This deal on Amazon with the Prime free shipping, and/or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do.  One of our favorites is layered graham crackers, this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping, and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting.  Lots of stores are discontinuing name brands, so this is a great item to buy here."
2267,2268,B001CWZXW0,woof woof,"My big boy Oreo loves this so much. i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit ,turkey. He can't get enough of this stuff"
2270,2271,B0052GPN0O,Wonderful fudge,"Bought 1/2 lb each of five different Mo's Fudge recently from a school fundraiser. I'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater, prefer peanut butter, but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible. So rich and creamy! Almost too creamy. Had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut. But if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover, this can!"
2271,2272,B00182I57O,Extraordinary!,"This mild semi-soft/soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that I have yet to find elsewhere.  The price is worth it, though I can't afford to order it often, but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight!"
2272,2273,B0016D2MY2,Amazing! Worth every penny!,This tea is absolutely incredible! Addicted after first taste. So delicious... the smell... the taste... it's a beautiful experience. I just ordered more (and gonna try both regular and decaf).
2285,2286,B003YMAET8,Taste good,I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.
2287,2288,B005QSIQKC,Top quality Salsa,Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.
2288,2289,B002MB2J6I,The best healthy muffin,"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal."
2294,2295,B003WWJ8LA,Avoid This Seloler,The picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but I was only sent one but was charged for three. Also the item sent was not the item shown. I can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store. I went to Amazon because I was looking for the type shown.<br /><br />When I contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping. Seeing as how I was shipped something I didn't order I should be entitled to a full refund including shipping. I was not offered that.<br /><br />If I could give this seller negative stars I would. Any future buyers beware.
2295,2296,B0001VWE02,Below standard,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2296,2297,B004NC7IFQ,WOW!  What a Deal!!,"I like loose tea, I just don't like chewing on leaves in my tea cup, or having to dispose of a bunch of loose, soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen. However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!"
2299,2300,B00176AIDU,SKIMPY for the price charged!!  Shocked!,"Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU"">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again ""Buyer Beware!!""<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! How's that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!!"
2301,2302,B007930DZS,Good Stuff,I love this frosting!  It's sugar free and I cannot find it in stores.  I will be ordering more in the future.
2302,2303,B0002Z9BF8,Charlee Bears,"Awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup/dog.  My two pekeingese just love these.  You can use them for training as well as just a treat.  They come in a variety of flavors.  My pups like the liver the best.  For senior dogs, these are perfect if they don't have the ""jaw"" power or teeth use anymore.  They are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood.  They are just 3 calories each so you don't have to worry about their weight.  Absolutely recommend these to every dog owner!"
2309,2310,B0001VWE0M,Below standard,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2310,2311,B0032JKWGI,Marathon Runner,I am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races.  This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.
2323,2324,B0001VWE0C,Below standard,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2324,2325,B0009FHDB0,My favorite crackers,"I have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out. I love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container. This makes them great to carry in my purse, take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc. Also love that they are not overly salted like so many American brand crackers. Company that shipped them did a great job - fast too!"
2327,2328,B000E5C1YE,"Exactly what I ordered, plain and simple","If you like SweeTarts and you want them in a bulk amount, this product is for you. The SweeTarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. There are no downsides."
2334,2335,B0001FQVCK,Chocolate Italian kisses - need I say more?,"My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term ""Baci Pill"" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!"
2339,2340,B002SOR6VM,"Great, healthy dog food for dogs with food allergies","My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste."
2347,2348,B002R6X1K6,The best pizza I have ever had!,"I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas."
2349,2350,B006GV6O34,Yum!,Great stuff!Love that it's organic and raw. But later saw same thing @ TJ's for less than half the price!
2351,2352,B001L4NJ1G,CHRISTMAS CANADIES,I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again.
2353,2354,B004VLVK4E,Great to be able to get this again,The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.
2356,2357,B000SAPUUC,"No caf, but no taste, either","When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is--hot water! True, the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping, but there's no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing."
2358,2359,B00637N4H0,Happiness In A Deep Dark Cup,"With the departure of Starbucks coffees, I reluctantly switched back to the other t-discs carried by local stores. I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: ""New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!"" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo brewer, because they make a great t-disc again!"
2366,2367,B001LQTDBE,Aunt Gussie's Pecan Meltaways,"I loved the quality and the taste of these cookies. They are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations. To the person that posted a bad review, just a small comment. They are called meltaways because they have real butter, go figure. If you are interested in low fat food, look elsewhere. It like complaining that french fries are fried, or that chocolate is fattening. Just saying."
2372,2373,B00196U7OI,Just Great,"I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no ""artificial"" taste at all. They're generous in size (3-4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120-140 each depending on the variety), they have 3-4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast."
2379,2380,B0000CGFV4,"Nice, Big Pieces & Big Almond Flavor","These were shipped out the day after I ordered them and arrived within 5 days.  (I live on the opposite coast where these are made.)  My order arrived nicely packaged.  For the price, I got 1 lbs. 4 oz. of biscotti (I weighed it on my kitchen scale) cut into 10 big pieces.  Add the shipping and handling, and that comes out to a little more than $2 per piece.  This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten ""as is"" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.  And, the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked.<br /><br />I like the almond flavor, but I wish this came in anise flavor.  That's my favorite biscotti flavor."
2380,2381,B0089SPDUW,New Favorite Dark K-Cup,"This coffee has a smooth, carmely, dark finish that I love! My husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me. This one is very smooth, with just a hint of sweetness. I wish that Amazon had it on its monthly purchase program, would love to save 15% on it! However, I was glad to find it someplace besides Green Mountain. As prime members, we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v. a week or longer over at GM. Sweet!"
2449,2450,B002JX7GVM,Sweet but not too sweet!,"Let me be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be very good. I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.<br /><br />At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.<br /><br />The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor."
2484,2485,B003ZRHYU4,The prime rib of beef jerky!,"This is a close second to my all-time favorite, Jack Links Beef Steakhouse Steaks, which is the filet mignon of beef jerky. They're very similar in taste and price, but the Steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly. Still pretty awesome jerky, very tender, and not a hint of fat or gristle. Bon appetit!"
2485,2486,B0027IQC5K,"Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets","Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."
2494,2495,B001ZWIRKW,My Dogs are Wild About These Treats!,"I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!"
2495,2496,B001EO6AWS,IT'S OK FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better."
2497,2498,B000EIE7GQ,Just like the restaurant!,"I recently moved and couldn't find a thai restaurant nearby. My favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry. I used the recipe on the back on the package when I got it, and it was JUST like what I get at the restaurant! Excellent flavor!"
2501,2502,B0004MZVIA,Diet Peach  Snapple Delivered Safely & Quickly,"I ordered this product to send to my friend's husband. They had just moved to Alabama in the end of March, she could not find ANY Diet Peach Snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in New Jersey. He said that the water that was used down South made the Diet Peach Snapple taste different ! So, now she is happy because she has found  a source that they can buy his Snapple from ! Thank you."
2503,2504,B003LKLK3C,Good quality for a good price.,"Previously I bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter, but the mustard I made with this seed is very tasty and (after mellowing a few days) not bitter at all. Pleasantly spicy."
2504,2505,B000EH2AMA,good stuff!,"In my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types, this is one of my new favorites.  Great taste, and although a hefty calorie count, the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run, if a real meal just is not an option!  VERY satisfying.  I also tried the white sesame crunch, and that is ok too, but this one wins for taste."
2510,2511,B0079LSXQ6,I Want More!,"I picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle [with the Easter goodies].<br /><br />This moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs. I used them, and wasn't the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />I paired the cake with Pilsbury's Pink Lemonade frosting, too. But you could have it totally un-frosted if you'd like! You will still love it!<br /><br />Perfect for the family dessert, children's cupcakes, or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea! If you love pink lemonade you are going to love this!<br /><br />The color just screams Spring and Easter! And the taste will leave you screaming for another bite!<br /><br />I give this 5-stars and my thumbs up!"
2515,2516,B000RUI0MS,Combo Rose Food/Systemic Insecticide,"This is a great product, so it's no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it, especially early in the season. Purchasing in bulk through amazon.com is a dependable alternative. Bayer 2-in-1 in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to 6 weeks, but you'll need a separate fungicidal/disease treatment, and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible. Bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms."
2522,2523,B004332EMW,Fisher Pecan Chips,"These chips are good to sprinkle on salad, use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal.  Very pleased."
2523,2524,B000NY4SZQ,hot mustard,This is the best mustard. my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work. it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating. Have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great.
2530,2531,B000G7UDPY,Wonderful!,"The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious. Nice lobster flavor; I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. Just open, heat and enjoy. I've become such a fan of the Baxter's line that I can't wait to try them all."
2545,2546,B000ED9LDU,"Lovely seeds for your cereal, baking or yogurt","In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.<br /><br />The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.<br /><br />We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt."
2571,2572,B000EGX2EG,"Tastes great but pkg says ""Made in China"" so I won't buy it again",Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.
2597,2598,B00504SMY2,lacey,not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables.
2598,2599,B002HQVIUQ,Best flavor!,"I am in love with this tea. Every other apple cinnamon tea I've tried has been too cinnamon-y. This is the perfect blend. It tastes like apple cider without all the sugar, which I love. I recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider."
2599,2600,B002HTQBIC,Perfect gift with a touch of the Southwest,"This is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair.  The jelly's were of decent size, the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached.<br /><br />Cute little bag - great gift for the price!"
2600,2601,B000M0RW86,It is okay,I thought it was okay but not Harbanero BBQ sauce from Hell.I would probally not get it again.Also it was not worth the money I thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10$ for barbque sauce you could have made at home.
2601,2602,B001IZKD1W,Italy's best pasta and its organic,"Montebello pasta has been made at the Monastero di Montebello in Isolo del Piana, Italy since 1388. I love Italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems, and their pasta is friendly to me, and it tastes better than any other pasta I have eaten, and that's a lot, it is one of my favorite foods."
2605,2606,B005BSQ56O,Good,Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee
2606,2607,B0015D8MOW,"What can you say, there chiclets",These are hard to find these days.  Product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty.  We kept the box for about 1 year and the last pack tasted as good as the first.
2608,2609,B0016FY6H6,"Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder","I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."
2684,2685,B000SAPXSQ,Real Rose petals and all  the delicious flavor!,"What a lovely tea this is! The rose petals are abundant in the mix, and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips, the full, sweet scent of roses greets you! This tea is perfectly blended and balanced! Its color is coppery-golden, very warm and luscious. I just want to drink it every day, for relaxation and sheer enjoyment!"
2694,2695,B00015BQB6,Yum.,"Good beans.  I can't find these in the grocery stores where I live, but ordered them through this retailer with no problems."
2698,2699,B004Z8F1JI,Works for me!,"I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract."
2700,2701,B002BXJRBW,Don't waste your money,We purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all! It was expensive and not worth the money.
2701,2702,B002HQKRIK,Koala Crisps rock!,"We've been eating this delightful cereal for several years.  My kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do I.  Unlike the popular junky cereals, this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it's a special treat for the kids.  I also like supporting Envirokids products - the pricing has come down to where it's nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you."
2702,2703,B000EPQPQE,Lemonylicious,"We received this as a gift, along with some homemade graham crackers.  My husband and I have become addicted to it.  If you love things like lemon meringue pie, you will adore this luscious,lemony spread on grahams, pound cake, etc.  Just a thin layer of this delicious confection enlivens your taste buds with an explosion of flavor.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very special treat."
2705,2706,B003NDA970,A Caveat,"The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper."
2772,2773,B004YUF9FS,Yummy!,"Got this for like $10 on a warehouse deal. It was a bargain! I received them in early May and the label says best before June. At a rate of one can per 2-3 days, I don't think I'll have a problem finishing them off before June. (I know, I have a sweet tooth). All 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good. They were just as described - soft cheese balls (about 20 per can) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom. Warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture."
2773,2774,B00002NCJC,thirty bucks?,"Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?<br />http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDY<br /><br />The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby."
2775,2776,B000J2DQ46,"In my opinion, the best clam chowder out there!  A perfect winter meal.","Bar Harbor clam chowder is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />1. I am not usually a fan of soup out of the can.<br />2. I am really picky about my clam chowder.<br /><br />That said, I get this stuff in bulk.  There are several reasons for this, the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes.  Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.  I know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but I really just want to taste the clams when I have a bowl of New England clam chowder.  If you're like me in that respect, then I think you will like this soup too!<br /><br />p.s. As a child, I was a fan of Friendly's clam chowder (before they changed their recipe).  Bar Harbor is even better!"
2805,2806,B00408CX8A,I love cashew butter!,"This arrived earlier than expected, which was great! However, for some reason, this particular product smelled a little like ""fish food"".... but no worries, still tasted like great cashew butter, just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. Also, I wish this product was organic."
2806,2807,B000MBO4LI,"Decent, but not great","When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."
2809,2810,B0081D0CU6,"Not full leaf, 1 pound, not 20 pounds","I ordered this Pack of 20 1-pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....<br /><br />1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1<br /><br />2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton<br /><br />Strangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again."
2810,2811,B003JH91RO,USA Chicken Stix,"This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my ""fur kids"" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line."
2814,2815,B000F70Y7W,Makes a good gift,"With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar."
2815,2816,B003TIUM5S,"great cereal, but too expensive online yet","I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR."
2819,2820,B0085G4ACA,Ambrosia.,"My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!"
2863,2864,B004DP0CXS,Amazon won't live up to their end,"The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description."
2864,2865,B002BB8POY,Safety Instructions for coca tea,"High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea."
2865,2866,B000PSFKE8,My pug loves them but I got a different hartz treat.,"I got a bag with 25 oinkies, pig skin with sweet potato in the middle.  But my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received.  It's still made by hartz.  The description of this product didn't say anything about sweet potato in the center.  So unless they update the description & package image I got the wrong product.  I'm only happy because my doggies are. :P"
2871,2872,B001IZI8LE,my favorite sugarless flavor,"Wrigleys' 5 FLARE sugarless gum is Wrigleys' sugarless replacement for their ""Big Red"" cinnamon gum. 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores. Thanks to Amazon I always have a supply. 5 FLARE is also the longest lasting gum I have ever experienced both in flavor and durability. It is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market."
2874,2875,B007OXJLM4,another great Green Mountain coffee,"I found this coffee flavorful and bold.

These cookies are so tasty!  I love the peanut taste and the crispness.  A one-hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them, but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on.  Probably the most important part of weight control is portion control.<br /><br />The cookies have 3 grams fat, 0 mg Cholesterol, and 2 Weight Watchers points."
2933,2934,B0042TR2WE,I love these!!!,"They all taste really good. It comes in Mango, Strawberry, and Red Bean. They are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time. There are 20 of each flavor as well. When I finish this canister I plan on buying another. *^^*"
2936,2937,B003Z9ZI1E,Amazing,"I got this after a mention in the NY Times and immediately became an addict.  It's a little hot but not too much, and it has an amazing depth of flavor -- a lot more than the plain version.  I use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo, to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings.  A little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes (instead of sour cream) is also great."
2937,2938,B0002TJAZK,Worked very well,"My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat."
2950,2951,B003XKKEBE,Best Green Tea Ever!,"A friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to Taiwan, and shared it with his coworkers. I was amazed when I drank my first cup. The best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery. It's a wonderful, clear and elegant tasting tea. I've never had anything like it, and can't wait for it to become available. Everyone he shared it with wants to buy some. A Japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea. Please offer it soon!"
2951,2952,B000H280KS,"Looks better than it tasted, I'm told","Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked."
2952,2953,B002GWME72,Wow!!!!!!!!!!,"BEST coffee I have ever tasted.<br /><br />My wife, neighbors and friends are all CRAZY over Jamaican Me Crazy!!!<br /><br />You must try it!!!"
2954,2955,B001GAJ7ZW,Parmesan Heaven,"I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor."
2955,2956,B000HKJNKQ,fantastic product,absolutely delicious  have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
2957,2958,B005MHHAUY,these beans were wonderful,"i have started the extraction process less than a month ago, and so far it looks and smell wonderful. waiting to try it.i have put 6 oz in 1.75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful. I plan on using the other 2 oz. in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc."
2958,2959,B0047LRBX2,Great Peanuts!,"Wifey bought these for me for Christmas.  I used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work.  After he left I wanted to try it myself.  These were great. 25 minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done. They taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could.  I might shell some of them and try honey roasting too.  I see a lot of people boil them, what are boiled peanuts like?  You don't see them up here in RI and I've never tried them."
2959,2960,B001EQ5ILA,Much better than tea bags,"Same great taste as the honeybush tea bags, but so much more green!  Thank you for packaging this in bulk!"
2960,2961,B003120XGK,Love this stuff!!,"We use this in place of sugar for almost everything.  It has a light flavor, sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor.  The best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index."
2962,2963,B0005YYHQY,Superlative store bought cookies: very hard to find!,"Buy these cookies. You will not regret it.<br /><br />They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).<br /><br />These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of ""new recipe"" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and ""soft baked"" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!"
2964,2965,B000GJQ8J2,Love this dressing! - Wild Thymes Products: Meyer Lemon Dressing,"I found Wild Thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products - the Lemon Salad Refresher is my favorite salad dressing, it is light, now cal, and very tasty. Excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh Heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. Yum! Their Customer Service is excellent and helpful, and the site shares some great recipes as well. I'm a fan."
2965,2966,B003U97K4M,almost expired seaweed,"The shipping was very fast, but so was the expiration date.... got it on Feb. 14, 2012 expiration is April 4, 2012 (only 6 weeks before it expires).  Who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time??????  I should have returned it, but who wants to go through all the trouble.  Well I stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable.  That's what you get when you order food online.  I will not order it again!!!!"
2971,2972,B0071H5VTU,"hard to find in New York, glad amazon can deliver it","This coffee was really good.  Been trying to find it in New York, but haven't been able to.  I think it's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered.  I've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic.  Also, I think the caffeine content is pretty high, as I'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands."
2973,2974,B000LKU03G,"Best tasting wheat free, gluten free cake mix available","This is my family's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. This brand is moist, tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to. Namaste products are the best in my opinion of what's available out there in health food stores. Try it! You won't be disappointed."
2984,2985,B0011X5S8Y,"Large Quanity, discontinued seasonal delicious tea","This tea is hard to find - it was a joy to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Large package -6 full size boxes arrive all for enjoyment!<br /><br />Sugar plum is a delicious, sweet, warm, feel good tea. Reminding you of Christmas. It has that spice palate of warm hibiscus, barley, rosehips. I think what I like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste. One of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of - a special treat when you are little. Like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and ONLY on those special occations.<br /><br />I adore this tea and rather drink anyother tea.<br />I am so happy to have found it!"
2991,2992,B0009JI7O8,A very pleased customer,"The fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well, i.e. none arrived broken.  The cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese (and not the modern version)."
3006,3007,B005UOJR50,great product--but a rip-off on this site,"This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue--Brooklyn. And I'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name ""LIAR LIAR."" Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip-off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please don't call me a liar. That's not nice you stupid thieves."
3007,3008,B000B2PDKY,"Great aroma, and I don't like coffee","Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me!"
3008,3009,B002BERULK,Jarred Paradise,"Amazing! My roommate brought this home because it was on sale and at first I just gave it a shrug. Within a week I was adding it to every combination of bread, peanut-butter, muffins, sauces, meats I had in my kitchen-- guiltily apologizing to my roommate as I scooped and slathered away. Anything I added it to, even if it seemed strange was immediately transformed into something wonderfully delicious. Even sweetening my tea and coffee with it had me in bliss. Needless to say, the jar was emptied quickly. I went back to the store to try stock up but they were all sold out and I haven't been able to find anything like it since. Please MacKays! bring your deliciousness back, I have a long life ahead of me and I've only just discovered you!!"
3009,3010,B000BRNQL2,Yummy!,"I bought this for my sister for christmas...she loved it, but was afraid she'd eat all of it at once, so she took the box to work.  Within 1 hour, it was finished by all her interns!"
3010,3011,B000HNE1IM,Tastes Like Wint-O-Green Life Savers,"This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. It's a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. It's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring."
3011,3012,B001LDOFJ2,"Good popcorn, poor shipping","This is good popcorn, I have purchased before in Hawaii.  I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.  It is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared, but rounded somewhat.  The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.  So when popping them, there are a lot of unpopped kernels.  They should use bigger boxes and wrap it better."
3012,3013,B000VDNGIO,It's like Buttah!,"Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.<br /><br />Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.<br /><br />If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin."
3013,3014,B0025UALB6,"Awesome snack, great product.","I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.<br /><br />If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.<br /><br />Why eat a nutritionally empty ""100 calorie pack"" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??<br /><br />I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.<br /><br />Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:<br /><br />Calories 80 (10 from fat)<br />Total Fat 1g<br />Cholesterol 35mg<br />Sodium 15mg<br />Total Carb 0g<br />Protein 18g<br />Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg<br /><br />You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says ""in water"" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.<br /><br />I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs."
3018,3019,B001FA1KUS,Quick wild rice is ok,"If you want the best wild rice, buy the regular kind. This ""quick cook"" type is not near the taste quality of the regular/ 40 minute cook time rice.,"
3021,3022,B000B9SFP2,"Very good corral for 1 horse, maybe 2 with additional electric tape","I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.<br /><br />There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.<br /><br />CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.<br /><br />ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½"" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.<br /><br />STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.<br /><br />CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.<br /><br />WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12"" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.<br /><br />CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)<br /><br />All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to ""contain 4-5 horses "", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time."
3030,3031,B0024T3HXM,Love it!,"I bought this color for a cake replica of the Stanley Cup that I made.  I was using this color for the very first time and I have to say that it was perfect!  I was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte, but it had a sheen and was exactly what I was hoping for."
3031,3032,B002HQP4YC,Real Truffle Oil makes a Difference,"This is the first time I have found a US produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. A lot of other ""truffle oils"" just have ""truffle aroma"" (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well."
3032,3033,B0052OI128,No more guilt snacking the grand-babies!,These cookies are amazing. They taste as good as if not better than the original brands. I only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie.
3040,3041,B0060OP9TM,Stay away from this company,"We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining, they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us.  We never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again.  Very expensive and no quality.  Stay away from this company.  We lived in Spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like."
3041,3042,B0033D3NHS,nice caramel flavor,"i purchased Cafe Excellence Crazy Caramel, Flavored Whole Bean<br />coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great"
3043,3044,B000GPY38E,orbit white peppermint is the best!,This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.
3045,3046,B002V5KFNY,Great Chocolates,"I bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in California, and she loved them. The chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautiful.<br /><br />Hand-written card, her name was hand-written on the front of the card, and extra care was taken in the whole process. I will definitely buy again from Choclatique.<br /><br />If I could rate higher, I would. I was sent a $15 refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby. I've never had such an honest company before, that was pretty cool!"
3047,3048,B004NNFEA6,Snyder's Best Flavor,"I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting."
3051,3052,B0000E65W9,A favorite quick meal solution,"When we get very busy in our home, I like this sausage a lot for quick meal options. The flavor is a bit sweet, and works well with lots of types of vegetables. Usually I'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done, then add sweet potatoes,potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet. With a bit of cheese on top it's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys. Mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for. For that I cut the sausage into coins and cook it up, then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual, add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking. The sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it's just so easy to make."
3053,3054,B003V1HH42,Best Coffee Ever...,"Having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker, we discovered Green Mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee.  I love the Island Coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a 2nd seat.  The roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through.  Try it with a little Chocolate Coffee Mate Creamer and you'll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the Islands...  YUM!!!"
3056,3057,B007GB7PB8,Flavor didn't work for me; back to Honey Nut,"I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I won't buy them again."
3057,3058,B0005ZWBPC,Delicious Treat!!!,"I became addicted to eating these the first time I tasted them which was years ago. Once you eat one, you just can't stop until they're gone. They aren't too sweet and make the perfect snack. I love these things!!!"
3059,3060,B0043JF3II,Not particularly good,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money."
3060,3061,B002SWR5VK,Excellent!,This is amongst the best Karachi Halwa I have eaten. Not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones...just perfect.. individually wrapped pieces in the box.
3061,3062,B000EHZZMW,My new FAVE pasta!,"I'm allergic to wheat so i have few options for pasta.  Corn pasta has a grainy texture that i don't care for, quinoa pasta is the same and rice pasta has a tendency to stick together.  This Orgran pasta is PERFECT.  I think i even overcooked it a bit and it still held it's shape(s) (farm animals!) and it was delicious.  My husband also agreed that it was really good.  The calorie count seems a little lower than other pastas as well.  i will continue to order this product as long as Amazon carries it!  It's GRRRRRRRREAT!"
3065,3066,B000FDKQCO,"My husband called these ""healthy brownies""","These brownies bake up very nicely.  I would call their consistency ""cake like"".  However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that ""healthy"" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes."
3083,3084,B000P151AI,Plenty and fresh,"I received all the ingredients in a timely manner. All the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages. It was more than I needed for the meal I was making, so I had plenty of left over ingredients."
3086,3087,B000GB7QXM,Excellent Casablanca Tea,I first tried this tea at at French restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint. To my surprise this tea beats any tea (without milk).. no sugar needed. It is naturally sweetened!
3087,3088,B001SB1R7A,Yummy!,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
3088,3089,B000GB7QXC,wonderful loose leaf tea,I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea.
3089,3090,B000EJLWZ4,Goodness!,With all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better.<br />I love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
3092,3093,B001IZIC7E,Wonderful Healthy Snack for Baby!,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor."
3103,3104,B003HAI9GW,Not Gluten Free!!!!!!,"Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!"
3105,3106,B004W8LIBQ,dog treats,Dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs.  But it is really a great product.
3106,3107,B001TZOA5Q,Delish smoked cheese I will buy over and over again!,"For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again."
3108,3109,B004JQVASM,Very delicious coffee!,"I have a history of mild/moderate acid reflux, so I take it easy with coffee. I was delighted to discover Puroast, which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced. The French Roast flavor is utterly delicious. It tastes like I went to a coffee house for fancy coffee, but it's just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen. (Even more convenient if my husband does it for me!) Try it - you won't be disappointed. The cinnamon flavor is also very, very good."
3125,3126,B000FDKQCY,Can be improved easily,"I use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg, which greatly improves the texture. When made with just water and a small amount of butter, the crust comes out very, very chewy in my breadmachine. I have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water, which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet."
3152,3153,B000HQR1HM,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS,"As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience."
3153,3154,B003OZYUEA,Delicioius Water I Didn't Have To Carry In,"To the gentleman who reviewed this and said ""just go to the store and get better,"" well, I'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry...can you see me carrying two big cases of water home?  I think not.<br /><br />This is wonderful water.  Sure, you could get it on sale at a better price, and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in, please do so, but for me it is a sweet deal.  I ordered six cases and watched the UPS guy set them inside the door for me.  I have nothing to complain about.  If the price is right for you, with all considered, you won't go wrong here."
3171,3172,B0001KL1Y8,A great buy,"Though this coffee was expensive compared to regular store-bought, I am a huge fan. Coffee usually tears up my stomach so I've been a tea drinker for years, but this coffee has a low-acidic level so I can handle it. The aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time. I am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus. It was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact."
3172,3173,B000F7GK98,AMEDEI,I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.
3173,3174,B001LO4Y24,"Its not Mango only but Grape, Pineapple","Do not buy this if your thinking its only mango.  Ingredient says ""Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree.""<br /><br />I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple."
3175,3176,B000LRIKZY,Bigger Amount/Smaller Price than Supermarkets,These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
3176,3177,B000FDKUSO,Suzie's Puffed Thin Cakes,"These are, without question, the best ""diet"" crackers I've ever had.  I've had them with and without salt and since I usually put peanut butter on them, I didn't need the salt.<br /><br />These are great for travel, for kids, and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker."
3192,3193,B000LKXQ32,The best organic green tea available in teabags.,"Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect."
3195,3196,B001YJ6M7Q,will never buy a different brand again,"I used to get these from Sam's Wholesale Club, but with this economy, I have not renewed my membership .. so long story short, I bought BumbleBee canned clams and they were HORRIBLE .. so then I bought Geisha Baby Clams and they were not as horrible, but I certainly would not put them in MY clam chowder, so I returned all the unopened cans of BumbleBee and Geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again ... oh, you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating POOP .. 'cause that's about all you get .. Clam Juice, and Clam Poop.  Doxee Snow's Clams are ALL CLAMS and CLAM JUICE no clam poop."
3201,3202,B002GWMGOS,Great Price,"These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, I'd suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop. I also remember a Pea berry out of East Timor that was outstanding, but this Tanzanian Pea berry is comparable to standard beans."
3202,3203,B000084DVR,Premium Quality Dog Food!!!,"We have been using this food for about 6 months now and find it to be just excellent! Other than the fact our two dogs (a Coton de Tulear 15lbs, and Standard Poodle puppy 40lbs) both love the food, but are thriving.  Their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect.  Good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner.  All around the best food we have ever used.  Excellent!!!"
3204,3205,B005K4Q1VI,"Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Milk Chocolate, Single Serve cup for Keurig K-cup brewers, 24 Count","I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed."
3528,3529,B005TY2REE,No cholesterol. No Sodium. Not Very Sweet. Good Taste.,"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
3529,3530,B001NH40UA,Fantastic Orange Tea,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."
3532,3533,B000YPKODY,STALE,I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.
3546,3547,B004P7JBMW,Very good compared to others,"If you're looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter (whatever reason) this is a good choice.  It's nice and crunchy, tastes better than other brands I've tried, and doesn't separate as much as others.  Best I've found so far."
3547,3548,B005ZHJI9C,Great and good price!,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
3549,3550,B000CMFMG8,Pschologically better than peanuts,"Somehow I feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. I don't know why either. Also, unlike peanuts, I can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag."
3550,3551,B000P5IWYG,What a great combo of flavors.,"I have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic.  I highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy, but tasty.  The mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing."
3553,3554,B00469LSMU,The best!,a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don't taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.
3554,3555,B0001E3LBU,Great Jerky!,I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
3555,3556,B005KDJEJK,outstanding,"recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym - had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa, but didnt really pay attention.  i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again.  huge difference in taste and quality.  sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well..."
3557,3558,B001HTI4TM,Olives that melt in your mouth,"I had no idea what this stuff was when it was served to me at a restaurant recently - and I could not stop eating it! Finally figured out it was Kalamata Olive tapanade, and I wondered where the heck can I get this stuff? I'm totally spoiled now! Well, I headed for where I always go when I want the best of everything - amazon.com! And there it was, and now I can have it whenever I want! I love tossing a bit with pasta, particularly the tomato and basil pasta I also order from amazon; it's great on salads, on humus sandwiches, and anything else you can think of once you get the taste in your mind hehe. It's fantabulous!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI4TM"">Peloponnese Kalamata Olive Spread, 7.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>"
3558,3559,B000GDAVXW,Really tasty,I got this for a gift for my father and he loved them.  I will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
3560,3561,B00762B7XY,an unsorted assorted,"Original description and order said ""Assorted"" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get."
3561,3562,B004G8ZAS4,Not what I ordered,These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.
3563,3564,B0092XAMDQ,More for Me,"This coffee is really rich, perfect in the morning. I ordered it for the office, but it was going fast. After a day or so I decided it was too good/fine to share so I swapped it out w/some cheap stuff and brought it home. More for me!"
3564,3565,B0040PWYVO,Great sweet organic corn! BPA not sure but looks like Eden's cans.,"This canned organic corn is great. Sweet and plump, and being organic is added bonus. Inside, the can lining looks JUST LIKE Eden's BPA free cans, but so far I can't find the consumer service number of the company to verify if their can is BPA free. At least I don't see the white plastic lining in these cans. I'm just hoping these are BPA free, then these are totally awesome!"
3572,3573,B0014DZQMO,"GREAT SERVICE, DELICIOUS CANDY","I ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light. I live on the west coast and this seller is in CA, so I got the Snickers in just a couple of days, instead of 10.<br />And their shipping costs were less, they shipped via post for under $5, instead of via UPS.<br />Lowest price I have paid for this candy and best quality."
3573,3574,B0044UT0O4,Great flavored tic tacs,These tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor. I did find them cheaper at the 99cent store 49cents a pack. I went recently and bought 24 for $12 heads up for anyone living in Ca.
3582,3583,B004MDQSDO,reminds me of Italy,"I rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta, but every once in a while, I eat some of this as a treat.  Almost as good as the pastas that I ate while in Italy!  Just make sure you don't over cook."
3583,3584,B000PWMHW2,One of my most favorite places on earth,"I love The Meadow.  So I guess this review is more about how much I adore this store, than it is about the salt (which by the way is fabulous).  I got my order way faster than I expected, which was nice.  I would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks, and even better if you can visit their lovely store in Portland.  This is one of the most romantic stores that exists.  Opening my box of truffle salt, and smelling that fragrant scent, was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers, salt, chocolate and wine.  Ah, it is a taste of heaven.<br /><br />The salt's great.  thanks Meadow people."
3584,3585,B003Y86ONM,Out of Date Chocolate,"The purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good, and made my home in plenty of time for Christmas.  The box was opened the day after new years.  The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.  They would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller. I still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so.  Then trash can."
3585,3586,B004X8TK9W,KEEBLER SOFT BATCH CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES 15-OUNCE(PACK OF 6),"A very soft, very delicious Keebler Brand Cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around $4.49/bag 'cause it's never on sale. I picked up my order of 6 bags through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon for $13.00, a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store @ $4.49/bag and hard to find usually in this variety! If the sale is right, I highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself!"
3590,3591,B006WW3GYC,Jelly Belly's are the Best,"Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!"
3592,3593,B001QEF4XC,quality at a good price,I don't understand why this dog food is not full of reviews. Checkout [&#8230;] they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which I use to use and diamond natural is less expensive.
3604,3605,B000HQMNIO,Best & Simpliest Salad seasoning,"This salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty.  It enhances the salad as it's not too over-powering.  It's a salty, mildly seasoned packet of goodness. It's also very addictive probably due to the MSG. Add olive oil and red wine vinegar, Mmmmmm.  I can't believe I found it here, b/c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore."
3609,3610,B001HTI5I2,"Organic, simple, and fast!","My husband refuses to eat fish, but he LOVES this. It only takes 10-12 minutes to make, and is way better than any other kind of Tuna Helper I've tried.<br /><br />Besides the box itself, you'll need:<br /><br /> - 1 can of tuna (6 oz., or I use 8 oz.)<br /> - 1 tablespoon of butter<br /> - 1 cup of milk<br /><br />It's a breeze to prepare, just DON'T leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in. Because of the milk, it likes to boil over. Just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling."
3611,3612,B000HDMW9M,Yum,Mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same Omega 3 content. My local grocery store hasn't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. No one can explain why. So I ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. I'm reordering.
3619,3620,B000R1BPOC,Just what I wanted,"These are wonderful!  Exactly like the originals, only in miniature form.  Delicious and crispy and the wonderful Amaretto flavor!  Rapid shipping from the seller as well!"
3624,3625,B004AGE1K0,Worth every penny!,We had candied chestnuts that came in a box in France many years ago and have since looked for them in the states.  This year I searched the internet and wa-la there were some products to try.  There were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good.  These came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in France but they are excellent.
3625,3626,B0015D44KS,The best bean,The best way to get Jelly Belly... a good price.. and you only get the flavor you want.
3627,3628,B0009P82YM,"Rich, Belgian Chocolate",Chocolate with coconut!  How can you lose?<br /><br />I love Ross Chocolates.  You can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate.  It is creamy and flavorful.<br /><br />I enjoy these (and I buy several flavors...all have the same great quality and taste) especially because I try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum.  I keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times.  They keep very nicely.
3629,3630,B000CS9ZTC,41 cents per 0.8 ounce is more than twice the regular price,"I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.<br /><br />$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.<br /><br />On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks."
3630,3631,B003CJJKDO,A very good brand.,"DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father-in-law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.<br /><br />If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.<br /><br />Enjoy."
3634,3635,B004SCD4NG,graet find,this product came as advertized..it was a great buy and I love the taste of the tea<br /><br />great deal and happy i purchase from them.
3635,3636,B003MPKGKE,"Oh, nuts.","I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.<br /><br />While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it."
3637,3638,B005RF029M,Best flour for pizza,I used this flour in my usual pizza recipe. I noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away. The dough was very elastic and easy to work with. The pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual. I will only use his flour from now on!
3642,3643,B004C20NH2,Follow recipe exactly,"If you follow their recipes precisely, with careful measurements, the freezer jams are excellent.  Strawberry jam is particularly appealing.  I've been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results."
3643,3644,B00433ICSC,yummy,"sweet, juicy and yummy. I have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. So addictive. It tastes just like those in Asian market. Actually this one tastes a bit better."
3650,3651,B0080IP5RW,Delish!,"Tasty, slightly different flavors then other brands, but good. In all other respects good purchase. Hard to find in US so I am not too picky."
3651,3652,B0010C0JYO,Excellent for authentic Chinese dishes!,This sauce is excellent for authentic Chinese dishes! My wife is from China and we love to use this product to make Hot Pot and Ma Po Tofu.
3652,3653,B002LO0TUE,Cute item!,"Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!"
3654,3655,B000YB7XQ4,BEST TEA!,"I use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than American teas - it just plain is!  It is all I buy, and now I get it for others too.  Look no further."
3660,3661,B000FDKQC4,A Bitter Pill,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left."
3680,3681,B000G33MVK,Great Product!,Woeber's Hot & Spicy Mustard is oh so good!  I'll buy another case when this gone.  Makes a great gift as well!
3683,3684,B000ER1DIM,My daughter's first word was cracker,I started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months.  She loved them so much her first word was cracker (while signing more)!  They dissolve in her mouth so I don't have to worry about choking.  And they are healthy too.  I highly recommend it.
3699,3700,B00113XJQW,"OMG, What a life saver","I have a pure breed GSD and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!"
3708,3709,B0045IK1CK,Delicious!!,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!"
3727,3728,B005TAGBVS,Really good product!,These bites are 'just enough' for a snack. They are delicious and the price is very reasonable! I will definitely purchase from this company again.
3728,3729,B004SFNFEG,Best golden berries I've ever had!,"I tried this brand first and I must admit I became spoiled because subsequently I went to Whole Foods to try and buy a bunch more. I had to get Navitas and found they were smaller, drier and less flavorful. So here I am -- this brand's golden berries are large, with a wonderful more succulent texture. The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into."
3730,3731,B000YSTH16,Yummy,"Both my boys have autism and are on strict GFCF diets.  The foods by ENER G are very good.  These cookies, although rather crumbly, are delicious!<br /><br />My youngest son calls them 'white cookies'.  I am a VERY picky eater - but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him!  You should try them with some chocolate melted on them...oooh divine :)"
3738,3739,B00016UX0K,What?  All These Folks Are Right?,"I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you."
3786,3787,B001HTKO86,Great for chicken curry dishes,"I have been using this curry paste for several years now, and it makes a great dish. Although it doesn't beat eating Indian out, its the best paste I have used for at home dishes. Even though this is a ""hot"" paste, I would consider it mild."
3789,3790,B0001N488G,My favorite tea of all time,"I first drank this tea at Naniboujou Lodge on the North Shore of Minnesota, and bought a small packet up there. I was hooked, so after I had drunk the first bit I bought I wanted to get more of this tea ASAP. Was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here. I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea -- specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea -- now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but -- whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know -- I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high-quality tea like this one. Sublime."
3790,3791,B001L1DYAA,best coffee,"The Gevalia Breakfast Blend is perhaps the best coffee I have ever purchased.  It is full-bodied, without being bitter.  It also is much cheaper to purchase through Amazon - with Free shipping for prime members.  Cant' beat it."
3803,3804,B007TGL2TQ,Almost Bought,"I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!!"
3804,3805,B000X2CWTM,Real Licorice,I received a box of this for Christmas. It is really good. Not overly strong like most black licorice. It is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with NO High Fructose Corn Syrup like most candy:<br />Molasses<br />Wheat Flour<br />Licorice Extract<br />Natural Flavor (Aniseed Oil)
3841,3842,B00199CELE,BEST BEAN EVER,"Wimpy coffee drinkers beware, this is not the bean for you.<br />If you like strong, bold flavor, you have found it in Larry's.  What a great coffee,<br />Starbucks move over, Larry is in first place!!"
3842,3843,B002Y2WM62,wonderful candy,i'm not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic. sweet and long lasting. my whole family is addicted to this great treat
3843,3844,B0017TRINU,Good product,"The first can that I got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way: an old, reused box with not enough padding.  When I complained the company was quick to respond - with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail.  I was impressed with their responsiveness.  The Merula oil itself was excellent - a great treat."
3844,3845,B002979DP0,Delicious alternative to soda,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars."
3846,3847,B0012R3N7C,Perfect!,"I have been looking for a nice strong rose tea, and this is the one!  I've tried a number of brands, but they weren't ""rosy"" enough for me.  This is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor.  No bitterness - nice and smooth.  I highly recommend this tea!"
3848,3849,B004S4S2OA,AMAZING FLAVOR!,"I visited a winery/vineyard in Tuscany where they sold Leonardi Balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines.  The flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth! I was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some ""specialty"" store balsamic vinegars.  It's like comparing skim milk (yuk) to cream - which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes?"
3849,3850,B002HY8GNA,Just as good as the others,"There are two types of larger suckers sold on Amazon, I got the tropical ones this time. Just as good as the regular kind. These ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts. Well worth the money."
3852,3853,B001M074MY,Tight Fit,"The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine."

3885,3886,B005GX7GVW,Great and good price!,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
3887,3888,B000GEVGXA,"Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real.","I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
3890,3891,B008G01KM8,"Good Malta, baffling business model","I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation.<br /><br />I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere).<br /><br />Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it."
3891,3892,B003SO2CV0,No worries!,"After reading that corn (and of course pop corn) was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it, I decided enough was enough. It was time to spend a little more and get organic. Supplier shipped quickly. Eden Foods puts out a great product. (Edenfoods.com). Certified organic and pops up nicely. I use a brown lunch bag (top folded down) with 2 TB of corn and 45 sec. in the microwave. (Your microwave time may vary). Voila! perfection. Add some splenda/cinnamon/cocoa powder mixture and yum yum. (mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray) Only 80 calories for 2 TB! No worries!"
3894,3895,B000A40OVQ,The only soy and dairy free shortening,This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it.
3897,3898,B004M1O1JE,Awesome chai,"The 500 Mile Chai is just wonderful - the right balance of mellowness and spiciness.  I've tried some chai's that are a bit too spicy, but this one is very well balanced.  Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the ""organic"" label...).<br /><br />Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile)."
3898,3899,B000CC9V42,Spicey Flavors!,"A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself. Truly flavorful! And hot! I use it in my omelets. Burritos. Nachos. Beans."
3910,3911,B00449NWW6,Awesome!!!,"Since the factory burned down that made Firecracker brand pickled sausage I have had to get by with the individually packaged version which doesn't remotely taste like the kind I grew up with, not to mention they are half the size.  These are the best pickled sausages I've had since my last jar of Firecrackers a couple years ago.  I saw the crappy review and I had to show my support.  As a person who grew up on these things I definitely know what I'm talking about.  If you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further!"
3920,3921,B005IZO3A0,Among the Worst Candy Ever Produced,While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.
3921,3922,B007ZTL8Z0,Good product,"This is good stuff, and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa. One store carries it at times but runs out and at times I send for it through Amazon.com. The price in the stores can be very expensive, and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at Amazon adds to the price. I won't discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost . My dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so I pay what I pay."
3922,3923,B002F8E47K,Better than expected!,"I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of ""nutty"" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def. rec!"
3923,3924,B000F9BCQ2,Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample."
3924,3925,B000VSDFRG,YUMMY!!!,"Wow, I have to admit these are really yummy. I don't know how they did it, but they don't have that ""imitation-sugar"" taste at all. They're small little bars (slightly bigger than the normal hershey's miniatures), but for only 30 calories a piece, they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office."
3930,3931,B0076ZJ21K,Like it a lot,It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.
3933,3934,B001EPPJII,Tasty Tea,"This is excellent green tea.  It is just a little spicy and very flavorful.  Green tea is so good for you, you won't even miss your morning coffee.  And..... you are helping children when you buy Tea District Children's Tribute tea."
3934,3935,B001AYBOPK,Tea was OK; quantity was big surprise,"This roasted green tea was only ""so-so"" to my taste. I've found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we can't return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea."
3935,3936,B001L1KH6Y,WOW!  That's some good espresso,"I use this coffee in my espresso maker and all I have to say it WOW!  The espresso is smooth, with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish.  It's the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me.  I hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans (like starbucks)and you don't get that with this coffee.  I LOVE IT and will be ordering more!"
3945,3946,B001FZR732,Best nuts ever!,"I have been ordering Koeze nuts over 20 years now.  The quality is as good now as they were when I was given my first jar.  I gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was ""these are wallhangers"".  They really are the best nuts I've ever had.  Enjoy!!!"
3949,3950,B002YSA1PU,Perfect for car trips!,"I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!"
3950,3951,B006FX6UKU,The cat's like...,"...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with."
3951,3952,B0049M8LRE,"nice flavor, too mild","The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but that's only because I would like a more intense flavor."
3952,3953,B0001N4886,Smooth Rich Blend,"I have fallen in love with this tea. I am a british tea fanatic and Ashby's has superceded my tastes and expectations. Smooth, not to bitter, low tannins awesome taste! I'll take this over PG Tips!"
3954,3955,B005HO0ARM,Good for dry skin,"If you have dry skin, give this a try. A doctor recommended I try this when I complained of itchy skin due to dryness. It's definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps I used to use.<br /><br />As someone already mentioned, the packaging design is horrible. I used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside-down in my shower caddy, but then decided to use a pump bottle instead, which I refill.<br /><br />Dove -<br />If you're reading this, please redesign these bottles so that they are more user-friendly. In Japan, you sell liquid Dove soap in pump bottles, and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag, which are far more eco-friendly and less expensive. Please consider doing the same for the North American market."
3975,3976,B003XW3YRS,Short fill,"I like the item or I would not have ordered it, However, I ordered 100 and 100 was confirmed. When the order arrived it contained only 96, four short. Rather skimpy. I usually like to receive what I ordered and for which I paid full price."
3978,3979,B008EMA3AS,Huge Fan,I've been using Lourdes Chimichurri for years - The stuff is awesome. I use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family's sandwiches. We're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. Highly recommend these products if you're looking for great taste without the preservatives.
3981,3982,B004DK7YHA,Sometimes it is good you have to mail order things.,"I was introduced to the Blair chips by a friend. I mostly ignore potato chips because I really don't like them. However, these I like the most among all the chips in the Blair line. They are savory and can be eaten rapidly. The hot chips are good because they are so hot, I cannot eat them fast. I am so happy I cannot get them at local stores because I would eat them all the time."

3983,3984,B0005ZHWXI,ADD SKIM MILK - BANANA - BLUEBERRIES  -  WHEAT GERM + MULTI-VITAMIN for A HEALTHIER CHOICE,"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!"
3984,3985,B000UZVPKE,Packed in the wrong oil.,"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best."

4011,4012,B000UZVPKO,"Healthy, tasty, convenient, and not too expensive","Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture."

4035,4036,B00115KS8M,Packaged Red Wheat Seeds,"I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product. The shipping is fast and it is packaged well. The cans are sealed well with a tight-fitting lid. Yes, I am going to continue ordering from this vendor again. They have exactly what I am looking for."
4036,4037,B000CMHMUC,Reboot your snack processors,"I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...""I thought you said 5 stars.""  It gets better.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!"
4056,4057,B006JW4TQE,"Yes, it really is Umm Umm Good!",This has been my favorite soup since childhood.  I was pleased to find it available on Amazon.com at a very reasonable price.  Now I plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times!
4057,4058,B001SAZIPS,Soooooo Delicious!!!!,"Zomg these cookies are sooo good!! I just bought some at the grocery store today after craving raspberry sweets. Wow, was this more than what I was expecting. Between the chocolate, the raspberry and the cookie it's heavenly. They actually put a nice and consistent amount of filling in these unlike most store bought brands. I would definitely recommend them, and I will surely buy them again when I'm having a raspberry and chocolate craving."
4059,4060,B000EY7P96,So very good,"My girlfriend and I bought some of this at stater bros for 4 or 5 bucks. Worth every penny. We use this on sandwiches instead of mayo. It is the best stuff. It's not healthy at all, in fact it is really bad for you, so keep that in mind."

Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.<br /><br />Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8.<br />Software: Garage Band.<br />Mic: Shure SM57.<br /><br />Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.<br /><br />Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.<br /><br />For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4."
4150,4151,B004391DK0,A product for Celiac's,"This product is excellent for the group of people who have Celiac disease.  A tasty treat for Sunday brunch. The only problem I have, is the cost, but<br />as we all know, being saddled with Celiac disease is not cheap."
4382,4383,B00474ARU8,Great Coffee,I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
4386,4387,B003JHN8D2,sticks are toothpicks compared to redbard bully sticks,These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.
4393,4394,B003ZJNJKG,"Yes, I live to eat this.","Great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers.  I cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs, hash browns, and this mix.  More heat than you would expect, have tried a couple other brands, not the same...."
4394,4395,B0001217OA,Fantastic,"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."
4395,4396,B001222JHC,Seven days of bad taste in your mouth,"The ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason.  They are brown, mushy, and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist.  On top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar.<br /><br />No living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul."
4397,4398,B002PJSKI8,Tasty,I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
4399,4400,B000GPKI10,Just what I was looking for,I was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these.  I have purchased this brand at Williams and Sonoma before but always in small containers.  I paid the same amount here for the bulk package.  I am very happy.
4402,4403,B0025VQGHS,Use For Pound Cake,"I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products."
4411,4412,B003SWCZG4,Actually pretty good.,"Ghirardelli isn't the finest chocolate you can buy, but it's pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.<br /><br />I've lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after-dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. That's been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works ""therapeutically""---if someone's having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isn't a bad path to feeling a little better.<br /><br />I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; that's the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, you'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn."
4414,4415,B0014157CA,Great for football fans who have everything.,"I got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift. I like that the basket can be reused. I have had the pasta before, so I know it is good. I don't know how the other items taste."
4415,4416,B000E5AO8O,Every BIT as good as you remembered!,"36 of these candy bars just might seem like overkill, but you can always tell yourself that you're going to give them out to company! Of course, the truth is that they are way too good to give away to anybody -- they can just go get their own.<br /><br />The good news is that they are shipped so fresh and soft that they will last 'till you can finish off your stash!<br /><br />They're awesome!"
4431,4432,B0002NYO98,LOVELY JUNIPER BERRIES,"Dried berries, still with texture and the quintessential aroma.

4439,4440,B0000GGI00,Pico Pica ... the BEST,"I love Pico Pica.  It adds some flavor, and it's not too hot. I eat it at least 2 meals every day. It's good on eggs, it's good on pizza, it's good on vegetables.<br /><br />Really, you can't go wrong."
4443,4444,B002YZESWU,"Adorable, great gift!","I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit.  Nothing was broken, it was gift wrapped (paid for this), and even came with additional salt samples.  I was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube.  More than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each.  It was well recieved and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  I will say I think the shipping cost was a tad high, but the salt was a good deal so it evens out."
4460,4461,B0096E5196,GREAT STUFF,THIS TASTE IS BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE FLAX BREAD AND CORNBREAD..... EXCELLENT TOASTED WITH BUTTER AND JELLY...DID NOT RAISE MY BLOOD SUGAR AT ALL.... I LOVE IT.
4462,4463,B000I6G2OO,Too good!,"My friend who lives in Fla. told me about these French twists and was complaining that she couldn't find them here in Middletown, OH.  I ordered 12 boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with them.......I couldn't stop eating them.  I ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so I wouldn't eat it too.  If a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings, they are a great addition to your diet.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stop!!!!!"

4475,4476,B001YJ8GKW,Chili soup?,"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again."
4477,4478,B0052T5464,Chock full o amazingness.,You can't beat the price and taste of this coffee. It will always be my first choice to buy. My husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. Little did we know it would become our new favorite.
4479,4480,B004DN7HJ2,agree with others. B U R N E D,B U R N E D<br /><br />I read the other two reviews and didn't heed their warning. That's on me.<br /><br />They are 'usable' but they were certainly burned.
4482,4483,B001EHDMY4,"Not Too Light, Not Too Sweet, But Oh What A Wonderful Flavor","Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Better Than The Rest<br /><br />I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.<br /><br />Complimenting Flavors<br /><br />Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means ""seeded apple"" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.<br /><br />Brewing<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!"
4492,4493,B002TMV3E4,"mellow flavor, no chemical aftertaste","This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future."
4588,4589,B0013ENGXK,Good stuff,"I'm surprised how much it tastes like coffee. To be completely accurate, it tastes like a watered down coffee (like the kind you get at hotels) with hazelnut flavor -- and a *very slight* earthy undertone. If someone gave me a sip and didn't tell me what it was, I'd think it were coffee, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.<br /><br />As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.<br /><br />And with even decaf coffee containing 5-15 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine. Anyone who needs a coffee substitute, do give this a try."
4601,4602,B00473DT6I,Great on biscuits,"I was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than I expected ginger flavor in this product.  It is excellent, if you like ginger, try this.  Best on hot biscuits!  Update.  I've just reordered, wish they sold it by the gallon, its different, something you can't find locally and excellent."
4602,4603,B003VXL14M,powder instead of leaf,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins)."
4604,4605,B004AH7BZQ,Best  peanut butter made,"Was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here.  Found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did.  I researched this company and they have been in business since 1898. This is the only preanut butter I really like. It is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better.  It doesn't need to add anything,  Great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable."
4605,4606,B00584HTX4,Mix - It - Up Scores Big,"This was a great Mother's Day gift. The packaging is unique, very artful, and well designed. Inside are different pouches for each of the Wine-a-Rita flavors. The box is substantial - it feels great wrapped up in wrapping paper. Also the Wine-a-Rita people had the foresight to put two different types of recipes on the box: one for wine and one for hard alcohol. Brilliant move in my opinion. My mom is not the biggest liquor drinker, so now she can make iced drinks with wine as the base rather than hard alcohol. Though other reviews state that they only received the drink pouches in a plastic bag, this was not the case for my purchase. I will update this review if we tinker with the recipes."
4614,4615,B0075WWDKQ,Nice Variety for guests or to try each flavor yourself,"I'd rate these as better than average but since I am not a fan of flavored coffees, I'd only give them a 3 rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do. The regular coffees were very good better than many. I really liked the Amazonia and the Africana medium roasts, not so much the Colombian. The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didn't care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K-cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up. The Chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious. If priced right I'd buy them again."

I haven't had a problem with them falling apart and they're easy to slice for toasting.  My son,(who is the one on the GFCF diet), is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new, ate these muffins without hesitating. I sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a 'bagel'.

This appears to be only one of two brands on the market.  I haven't tried the other one (I think it's called Sportmix) because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs.  My dog has been eating one a day and I can't say for sure whether or not they work. She used to have really smell gas; she hasn't dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe it's due to the biscuits - who knows?  She does like these biscuits very much, so I will surely buy them again."

With these, you can have those snacks again without having to worry about the calorie content of your crackers!<br /><br />They're only 17 calories a slice, and each slice is about the size of a 3 x 5 notecard. They're delicate and have a nice easy ""crunch."" These ones in particular have a lower sodium content as well, versus the pesto and garlic ones (they're a bit higher in sodium content, over 200 mg per 3 slices).<br /><br />It's an excellent addition, no matter what diet you are on...or if you're not even on a diet! I bring them to parties and everyone always asks what they are and where can they get them."

Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Turducken clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just ""mush"" or Spam-looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Turducken and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors."

Order directly from the Daddy Sam's website to pay $5.50/19 oz bottle.  This price would HAVE to be a case price although the description says 19oz.

4700,4701,B00283LQR8,"Dog loves the food, but the cans were badly dented","My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like ""people food"" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well....."
4701,4702,B0048IPR9Y,Wow!,"I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart.

You get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring.  Wow--it's a great snack that you feel good while eating.  It is my favorite of Trader Joe's almond snacks.  Almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein, the healthy fat and the Vitamin E that almonds offer. It's a good idea to measure out 1/4-1/2 cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within. Nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein."
4870,4871,B001TY6T6K,WAY OUT OF RANGE COST,Are you kidding me! $32.00!!! I buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under $10.00. No more then $15.00 at reqular stores. Watch these prices guys.
4873,4874,B002C56OBU,My Community Coffee,"I lived down in Louisanna for 10 years, and Community Coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee. Here in Iowa I can't buy the Comm. Coffee, so when I saw the ad to order through Amazon I jumped at the offer. I got 3 bags of the Hazalnut and I am in Coffee Heaven right now, Thanks Amazon."
4889,4890,B000QSONJA,"False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!","I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."
4890,4891,B0018ATXEU,Om nom nom,I'd rank Toffifay as tied with Ferrero Rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever. Sadly Toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live. I thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but I'm going through these things like nobody's business. At this rate I'll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
4896,4897,B004JWS0CA,"Full flavor, non-acidic, best K-cup so far!","I have been experimenting with K-cup brews for almost 2 years now.  I tried Timothy's Colombia Excelencia ONLY because it was on sale and I was still looking for THE ONE.  Well, I finally found it.  Columbia Excelencia is the best breakfast coffee I have found to date.  Rich, full-bodied, with a clean non-acrid finish.  It goes well with milk and Splenda, no odd aftertaste whatsoever.  Donut shop is my favorite over ICE, Newman's Nantucket is my favorite BOLD, Timothy's Italian goes best with dessert, and Colombia Excelencia is the first thing I drink every morning."
4905,4906,B0009JMW1C,Real Sinus Buster !!!,"My husband has been taking this Sinus Buster tea once a day (before bedtime) for about 6 months already, he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone. This tea is so wonderful and it really helps.  When he skipped for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again. Don't want to skip it for so long anymore. Highly recommended."
4927,4928,B000FYYOZI,Popular with some - not me,"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone.<br />I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.<br />This company has superb customer service!"
4949,4950,B002RZ1QNG,This is a good wine but I made some modifications,"This wine actually turned out really well.  I made some modifications to the kit however.  If you figure out the potential alcohol content, this kit would probably get around 7%, but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation, I ended up with 13%.  I also didn't use the whole f-pack.  It would have been WAY to sweet.  Instead, I topped the carboy off with an unoaked Chardonnay that I like."
4960,4961,B001DW2RGO,Great substitute for 5-hour energy,"6-Hour Power's ingredients are pretty much the same as its rival, 5-Hour Energy's, so obviously the effect is pretty much the same. Yet, this cost me $18 for 12 while the other cost me $8 for 2 at the nearest store.<br /><br />Great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a week.<br /><br />The taste isn't as tangy and addictive as 5-Hour Energy's berry flavor. A bit bland in comparison, but it's still nowhere close to bad."
4970,4971,B0061YK3O2,Excellent original Greek olive oil,"Being from Greece I can say with certainty that this is an original Cretan olive oil. Its pure and full taste makes it ideal for cooking, salads and dressings. We were thrilled to find here in USA an original product deriving from our country and my wife likes to use it every time she cooks, resulting in tasty and full flavored foods. I would strongly recommend this basic component of the Mediterranean diet to anyone who want to improve his nutritional habits."
4975,4976,B003J5U3K0,Dog likes these a lot,"I have a Pit Bull who is a little over a year old. To say he is food motivated is an understatement. However, with that being said he is still picky. He adores these treats and others from Darford. I do much research before I feed treats/food to my dog and I could not find any bad information on this company. I promote these treats to family/friends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked. Good wholesome treats."
4976,4977,B004FW1DIW,"Another ""True Chews"" My Pup Loves","Out of all the brands of bully sticks, True Chews has to be one of me and my dog's favorites.  My favorite because they are not messy, they dont break apart as easy as some of the cheaper brands, and they do not smell!  My pup loves it because it doesn't make him sick, doesn't give him gas, and gives him hours/days of fun.  Their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy/dog with a sensitive tummy.  FYI My pup is currently 5 months old and is a 8lb Shihpoo.  I gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive brands and that they are a tad hard to find locally."
4978,4979,B001EO5ZDI,Not good quality,"I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that weren't had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality."
4984,4985,B000N1LF96,try it with ramen noodles!,"I'm not the best cook, but I like to try new things to make my diet healthier.  I confess that I LOVE ramen noodles, and this product helps me cut the salt content.  The flavor packet that comes in Ramen noodles usually has between 600-900 grams of sodium per serving (2 servings in the packet...I eat the whole thing, so that's a LOT of salt.  This Miso contains 880 grams sodium per tablespoon.  I add a table spoon to my ramen, then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet, cutting the salt almost in half, while still adding a nice savory flavor.  I also add a handful of frozen peas, but I like to keep it simple.  I'm sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there, so enjoy!"
4985,4986,B004PDGUFC,Love Flavia Coffee,We are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe French Roast also. It makes a single fresh cup at a time in our Flavia Coffee maker
4986,4987,B0017T556M,Cinnamon Good,In my area one cannot find Cinnamon Mentos.  I am so happy I was able to find this flavor.  I just love this product.
4988,4989,B000H25QVO,"Yes, It is Good","This is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of ""old"" green tea. Stay away from the big brands like Lipton, Twinnings, and Bigelow. They do well with black tea but not green.<br /><br />For green tea go with this, Uncle Lee's, or Tazo. You'll never be able to go back to the others, which will taste like swill from a polluted river.<br /><br />This is real green tea. And it's not expensive. Recommended.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rusk Reeder"
4990,4991,B004TTSB2C,Love em'!,They are awesome to snack on.  They have a little kick to them but that's the best part.  They help me with my cravings for sweets.
4992,4993,B002Z9NKUG,INDIGESTION OF MAJOR PROPORTIONS,"I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.<br />Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.<br /><br />She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.<br /><br />But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the ""occasional upset"" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!!"
4993,4994,B000FA398U,Best for oyster soup!,"Try these first for all your seafood soups and stews.  They're just amazing. The flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful.  Plus, these are great just to snack on out of the bag.  Kids love them!  We use them for chilis, soups, and recipes as well.  Highly recommend!"
4994,4995,B00653KJ5M,AMAZING!,"If you are on the paleo/caveman/primal/hunter-gatherer diet, YOU WILL ADORE THESE COOKIES!<br />otherwise stay away, your taste buds aren't attuned to the uniquely sweet NATURAL cookies. End of story Paleo PURCHASE, SAD (standard American diet) skip it"
5004,5005,B0007XXPPW,Too expensive to buy here.,Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.
5005,5006,B003BLBVOY,Happy to have found this product,"With all of the choices of things to drink, this is an excellent one. It tastes great. Most of our choices are either loaded with sugar, or carbonated ... even milk is sugar-dense. This drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol. It is an excellent thirst-quencher. So much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade! It does, however acidify the pH. I am supposed to be alkalizing my diet, so I can't drink a lot of this. :(<br /><br />From the time I was a small child, my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health. Hippocrates would have been happy to discover Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar All Natural Drink: Concord Grape Acai :))) Try it and drink to good health!"
5010,5011,B000KOWNHE,BEST Gravy ever!,This is the best ever.  Just add HOT water and mix.  Yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups.  Add some sausage and you are in Heaven.  Yummy Yum.  Cannot go wrong ordering this product.
5012,5013,B000HDKZDC,Best cereal bars on the planet,"We use these for our daughter for a few reasons. One, they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market (whole grain). Two, they have yogurt incorporated into the bar. Three, the are thick and do not easily crumble. Since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1, not having to clean up after she's eaten them is a BIG plus.<br /><br />Plus, they are super yummy for adults too.<br /><br />They are more expensive than others on the market (esp since I can get Nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount) but they are worth it. Makes our life easier and they don't have a ton of added sugars!"
5023,5024,B000N5YM10,Seasonings,Good product! good price  fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better!
5026,5027,B000H25QVY,Hard to find better,"As an avid rice cracker fan, I've tried a lot of different varieties, and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes. Obviously some of the best are in the Japanese grocery stores, but at least in my case, they're out of the way most of the time.<br /><br />The crackers themselves are savory and crunchy--exactly what I look for in this snack (and this particular mix is nothing but crackers!).<br />Thanks to these, I've stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations."
5027,5028,B000FPKZZA,Dingo Bones are the best!,"Our Corgi loves all sizes, shapes, and flavors of Dingo Bone treats!  The other reviewer commented on the VENDOR; we've never got a bad Dingo yet!  Highly recommended!"
5029,5030,B001EO6BCC,do not buy these,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
5033,5034,B007WPNFJ4,a very good product,"I recommand this product. My childrens (5 and 3) love it, pouches as very usefull especially for breaks.<br />To choose. Enjoy"
5034,5035,B001EO6BCM,Christmas shopping,I've tried many different brands of Virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best. I've turned my entire family on to this brand and they've ordered them also. They're superb.
5035,5036,B004LB7A5W,Sweet Paprika - Good with Everything!!!,"First of all, there are two kinds of paprika - sweet and hot.  Both are delicious but the Szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind (which is also awesome!). I have been using this spice for years and the Hungarian type is consistently better than any other type/brand.  Use this on meat, veggies, cassaroles, salad, baked bries, quiches, egg dishes, shrimp, pretty much anything.  I use this in soup all winter long, especially with gulyas levas (this is a traditional Hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash) and czipetke.<br /><br />This product is the large restaurant size, which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it's versatility!!!!"
5036,5037,B000UXH9ME,Excellent Product!,"I was so pleased with this purchase. A great value since I got them on a monthly sale!! I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good ""crunch"" in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening, although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while."
5037,5038,B000T8XZOQ,Makes a GREAT skinny margarita,Not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita.  Also try their Agava Simple Syrup - LOVE IT
5038,5039,B004QPUGZY,"Adding a ""touch of heaven"", but without any of the bother!","I adore using this very vanilla bean paste ESPECIALLY for my cream pies and ice cream. Why, it's like adding a ""touch of heaven"", but without any of the bother of scraping out vanilla bean pods. The flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans. The price is WAY, way better too and it's stores fabulously on the shelf for ages!<br /><br />For combined shipping, be sure to get their SWEET DOUGH FLAVORING and POWDERED VANILLA too. You'll be glad you did!<br /><br />For more cooking tips & techniques... google my name SharonAnne."
5039,5040,B0026RHUP8,My Family's #1 Formula,"Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has ""prebiotics"" added in.  Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent's Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent's Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent's Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson's decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.<br /><br />Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a ""modified polyester"" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).<br /><br />Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn't buy a better formula than what's on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.<br /><br />If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).  They are all excellent infant formulas.  You just have to see what works for you and your baby."
5049,5050,B001EO6BC2,peanut brittle,Have tried a few different peanut brittle's from Amazon and this is by far the best. It is LOADED with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage.
5051,5052,B000E3ZFIK,Good graham crackers for my kids,"I like that these are organic and don't have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  I'd give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily.  And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be.  The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, don't expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two, and quite a few are broken at the edges as well."
5057,5058,B000FA3980,Amazingly Good!,"These are very good, they were a great price and fast-free shipping when you purchase enough food.  The only thing is that the box was smaller than I guessed it would be."
5059,5060,B0017JHLA0,deceptive photo,"I felt ripped off. The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a ""bone"" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesn't the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasn't worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe"
5060,5061,B005OE12MM,Yum,"Wow I heard of this candy but could never find it, now I am hooked. Now I don't have to suck on child lemons with salt, just shakey shakey."
5061,5062,B007OWEOIQ,Delicious!,"I absolutely love these! Seven of these sweet, very thin Graham Crisps are only 60 calories, but it's easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package. Delicious by themselves; wonderful with ice cream. If they are purchased using Amazon's Add-on Program there is no shipping charge.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've seen mixed reviews of this company's products. The items I've purchased have not been stale or strange smelling."
5064,5065,B001872UAW,Another good soup from HC!,"This soup is good. I really love this brand of soups..my favorite being the Chicken and Dumplings. Healthy Choice isn't always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups. I love them, they taste homemade and amazingly better than Campbell's or Progresso. I recommend this, the Chicken and Dumplings, the Split Pea and Ham...in fact, every variety I've tried has been delicious. You can't really go wrong with this."
5069,5070,B005H3BYHI,Tiny bubbles...makes me happy...I don't want to share!,"First off, there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass. A big difference.<br /><br />I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.<br /><br />I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn't sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.<br /><br />I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it's in a glass. I'm not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I'm a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.<br /><br />A lot of people are mentioning it's over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it's not Amazon selling it, it's a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.<br /><br />But I'm happy it's at my local health food store. I'm not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks, Taste Nirvana. This really is ""Happiness in a bottle."" Go get your own. I'm not sharing ;)"
5079,5080,B001FPV0OO,Great mustard,This will ruin supermarket mustard for you. High quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through.
5081,5082,B000KK5O7E,Very tasty,"A very tasty little cake. The cake was surprisingly moist, and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. We'll definitely be buying this product again."
5083,5084,B004IJ71QK,Tulsi Sweet Rose Tea,"This tea actually tastes the way a rose smells.  It's like sipping on roses when you drink it.  I'm glad it can be purchased on Amazon because I looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores, like Trader Joes, that carry unusual food items and could not find it."
5084,5085,B001EO5ZFQ,No Heat!!,"It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring."
5094,5095,B00080MJE2,A good mix in with other looseleaf teas,"It's not great plain, but it's wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you don't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It's a great tea for children because it's mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.<br />Also, you can eat the rosehips after they've been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that's the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn't been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips."
5095,5096,B001VNGLJE,Delicious,"These cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent. I use them in cooking, I let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil, and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles. It works well on all counts. I am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed."
5096,5097,B0000D94SZ,"A Summer Treat Fat Free, Guilt Free","This mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday.  Its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe's.  When you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity, this can fill the bill quickly and easily.  It has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks.  I highly recommend it."
5097,5098,B004157PZI,Beef Jerkey is AMAZING!,"When I opened the package, I expect the same old tasting Beef Jerky but my taste buds surprised me.  This beef jerky tastes amazing! I've been buying products from Amazon.com for years was really inspired to leave any feedback but as soon as I tasted this Beef Jerky, I wanted everyone to know.  I just ordered 5 more :)<br /><br />- Baba Ali"
5105,5106,B0073FG1H6,Tasty,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a ""hint"" of lime."
5106,5107,B001HOUGFC,Pleased with Product,"Product arrived on time, nicely packaged and gift wrapped, the treats were all quality and very good.  Nice keepsake box."
5107,5108,B000MBZGCY,Great Alternative to Cough Drops,"I got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop. These are gummi and are minty like a cough drop, she really likes them. A unique gummi creation."
5108,5109,B000FVW1B0,Yum yum!,"This oil is wonderful. I've had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what I was using it for (salad, cooking).  I loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more."
5109,5110,B005BD7WMK,Twinings Earl Grey decaf tea Kcups,"I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I don't love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn't deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice."
5110,5111,B001VNGN0Q,Fragrant and delicious,"As someone who goes through lots of thyme (I use it in everything except cereal), I was pleasantly surprised to see this product on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Looks, smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5-10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house :)."
5115,5116,B008QXKU4O,Best Italian olive oil,This is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic Brings you to Italy Use on salads breads for dipping.
5116,5117,B006FXWRX4,"item as described, shipped on time - thanks!","this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for Christmas!!  Thanks for a reliable, easy shopping experience."
5117,5118,B003QM6ZDU,So good it could be a beverage!,I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can't seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
5120,5121,B0028VAQSU,Pamela's WHOLESALE Baking & Pancake Mix,"Pamela's makes an awesome, delicious, easy to use wheatfree baking mix.  The 25 lb bag is clearly a wholesale product, coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels.  In January Amazon was selling this product for $66 which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item, especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix.  Now they are charging $82 for the exact same product which makes it MORE expensive than buying the same product offered as 3 of the 4 lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging.  Something isn't right with this product offer, anymore.  Shame on you Amazon.  You're supposed to be above such schemes!<br />STILL, swear by Pamela's wheatfree Baking & Pancake Mix.  It's the BEST."
5140,5141,B0031YJ38W,Best of Breed,"I started eating these after reading Esselstyn's popular book on heart disease (heal through eating oatmeal).  There's no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal, and the three that I've tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless, the Fruit & Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).<br /><br />In short, you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the ""Fruit & Nut"" flavor--have to be a little ""fruity"" (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") or a ""health nut"" to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so). And the advantage of the ""mini"" size is that you might feel better--less guilty, at least--about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time."
5158,5159,B000WMPGDW,Heaven on earth!,"If you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight, try dulce de leche and this brand is the best! As a native of Argentina, I grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close. Serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar, with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way. Very sweet!"
5167,5168,B0002UDY9W,hooked,"I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it.  Now it seems assumed I will keep her in stock.  That alludes to a completely different product review.  The point is, buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home.  It seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least.  My only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers.  My GF usually gets what she wants."
5174,5175,B003FWKCB2,The perfect corn-syrup free replacement candy!,"I love gummy bears. Love. I also love to eat healthy, and for me that means avoiding corn syrup whenever possible. I was sent these gummy bears by accident when I ordered the sour gummy bears (also by Surf Sweets) and I am glad I was, as these are absolutely delicious. They have the same texture as regular gummy bears, though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier.  Some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears, but I think that is due to the lack of corn syrup. I don't really notice any difference. Note that these do still contain gelatin, so vegans should NOT eat this (I think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans). The natural fruit juice flavors are delicious, and the fact that you get your vitamin C as well is just an added bonus. I would definitely recommend these, though I suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go!<br /><br />One last caveat - if you are on a budget I suggest you go with the Surf Sweets Sour Gummy Bears (also available on Amazon) as they are ten dollars cheaper. I'm still unsure of the reason for the price difference, but if you're on a budget the other ones are great too!"

5184,5185,B003R0LKSG,Tip on the 'pop top' can lids,"If you're setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use, flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can. You can then pop the top of the can, releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly. Much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon!"
5205,5206,B000G1X456,As Good As Gourmet,"This Yuban DARK ROAST is outstanding.  It is smooth with a chocolaty taste.  I find it as good as any far more expensive coffees.  I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.<br /><br />I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks Starbucks is far, far overrated (bitter, burnt)."
5217,5218,B0075NJG3W,Contains food preservatives,"Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating."
5218,5219,B0009OMU00,The most popular snackfood in our night club...,"I own a small night club and this is, hand's down, the most popular snack item we have. At first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore. In addition it is not available anywhere in town and, before we found it here, we had to go to a Sam's club 50+ miles away to stock up on it. apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find. The company also makes a ""Club"" mix, as opposed to the ""Pub"" mix. I made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele. They look about the same but apparently the Club mix lacks some vital ingredient."
5233,5234,B0012YEKCW,"easy to grow, my cats love it",Cat grass seeds will sprout very easily---you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss.  My cats eat the sprouts very quickly.  I suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs.  I did so to insure that I would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled.  The only drawback is shipping cost--which is more than the seed packets themselves.  That's another reason to order in multiples.  The shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet.
5273,5274,B001AQS7JE,Really nice flavor,"I just picked these up at random at my local Asian market, and I am really impressed. I'd drive the 15-20 minutes there again just to pick these up. They have an excellent coffee flavor and aren't horribly sweet like most hard candies. Each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time."
5277,5278,B005FGPXDS,GOOD CAT FOOD,My cats really love this 9 Lives Seafood and Poultry cat food.<br />They prefer this pate to the slices or chunks.<br />They are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats<br />and lots of energy.<br />It is good quality food and is very fresh.

5295,5296,B002TMTP12,3000 != 850,"The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  I'm not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  It's true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850, but apparently I glossed over that fact.  The price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on Amazon; just not quite as good as I had originally thought.  Shipping took a week longer than expected, but I did receive and apology email.  The gumballs themselves were well packaged.<br />I would buy from this vendor again (assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me)."
5296,5297,B0017T1LI8,Best Tea on Earth!!!,"I LOVE this tea. It is, hands down, my favorite.  And the ingredients are very ""clean"" and it's low calorie--especially compared to other teas out there.  This is the real deal.  It's basically like making it at home.<br /><br />It's SO yummy!  Light, refreshing.  I could drink it all day, by the gallon.  :)"
5300,5301,B003OJLCXI,"Should be called ""Toasty Tasty Cherry""","Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!"

5313,5314,B007Z3MST6,Kill Cliff Sports Recovery Drink,"The best thing I like about this sports drink, is it's not an energy drink. Low calories (15) and less caffeine then 8 ounces of coffee.<br /><br />Plethora of natural anti-inflammatory ingredients, which mitigates aches and pains. And it's not necessary to take over the counter Acetaminophen when you have this.<br /><br />When I first had some, I felt different. Not a amp different, rushed. Just different; scared me a bit. 3 days later I tried it again. The feel different was the pain level going from the constant 8-9 to a 6 (which is manageable for me). The feel difference, was me feeling better.<br /><br />This is giving me the 4-5 year window I need before I have to get my neck and spine fused (again).<br /><br />At our house now, we have at least 3 cases and this month, it is 4."
5314,5315,B004RDRHAW,"Extremely pricey, but one of my favorites","This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but it's one of the few I've found that is salty enough and doesn't contain a bunch of sweeteners.<br /><br />The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me."
5316,5317,B004LQT0JG,A decadent snack!,"These were a wonderful surprise, more delicious than anticipated and guilt-free. I liked the smaller size pouches. Easy to carry with me; nice to give as a gift. The bonus is that they are organic. I will be buying more."
5320,5321,B000BYLQW6,Vitakraft carob dog treats,"The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.  We live in central California where temperatures get into the 100s.  I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.<br />Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.<br />Excellent product..."
5335,5336,B0058HWQO8,Too much for shipping,This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.
5336,5337,B004565GV8,Tastes like the real thing!,"Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it!"
5364,5365,B000G671RI,A poor choice,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way."
5370,5371,B000H27K86,I miss the south!,"I have a hard time finding this up in New England - so glad to see this product here.  This is my favorite product in my spice cabinet.

5386,5387,B00622CYVS,Great variety means no picky eaters!,"We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the ""regular"" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.<br /><br />I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.<br /><br />Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it's a wash.<br /><br />If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:<br />*Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same<br /><br />*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount<br /><br />*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here!"
5428,5429,B0077QDHA0,Soothing; Subtly Fruity; Unique; Good balance.,"I found this tea when I explored a local grocery store on the north shore of Oahu on a trip to Hawaii last summer. Every now & then I like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasn't totally bizarre. (How you'd guess I'm American?) I enjoy white, black, flavored & herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, non-dairy creamer, rosehip extract & refined sugar. I've never considered putting non-dairy creamer into tea. Would it be a mess I dumped into the mug & stirred to death? Instead, I found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil-like moisture proof package.<br /><br />After steeping ~3mins, I was thrilled to discover a light-flavored cup of tea, slightly fruity-scented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. And no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />A year later I found one of the packages in my luggage & found it just as tasty & easy to prepare as last year. I went online to buy some more & was thrilled to find that Amazon offered the same item & a couple of other flavors by the same company too!"

Went great with chips as a dip, as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings.<br /><br />I am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin. I think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores. Plus it is from a small business.....win win win!<br /><br />Thanks again Everidae Sauce for a great change of pace!"

At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out."

5441,5442,B00622CYVI,BPA no longer an issue,"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least."
5494,5495,B001VNEC68,Beautifuly fragrant and citrusy coriander! Very fresh!,"Coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often. Sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it's usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice. The Frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust, full, very rounded and well-balanced  and very palatable, mouth watering flavor with hints of lemon, not extremely overpowering of all of your other flavors in whatever your making either, which is very nice because this allows you to use it liberally if wanted. It goes good on meats and vegetables and also smells great when you throw a handful in the bbq smoker and let the coriander smoke do its job on the meat and veggies on the bbq. The Frontier coriander powder is of exceptional value and quality, if you like coriander and think you'd like to start experimenting with it in your recipes I'd recommend buying some and re-discover the world of delicious coriander."

5525,5526,B007TFPHSO,Wonderful!!,"I'm so glad I found this seller.  I just purchased my Keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box.  It was fun picking out all the flavors I wanted to try.  If you go over to her website, [...], there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock.  After purchasing, I immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests. I received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later!  How's that for customer service? And the shipping was lightning fast!  I just received my package today (Monday) after ordering Thursday night.  All cups are accounted for and I'm already enjoying one of the cups I received.

So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up.

The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.<br /><br />The price is right."
5530,5531,B002Y7520K,Tasteless flavoring,"Maybe it's just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can't taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing."
5534,5535,B000NSNB9G,A bit pricey but yummy!,We have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in Tuscany. This is from the same region as our favorite. The consistency is just a bit runny. It has moderate chunks of garlic. It was quite tasty!
5535,5536,B004RO7NZ0,Something is Very Wrong Here,"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.<br /><br />The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED."
5537,5538,B0049M7LES,Yummy!,This hit my sweet cravings perfectly. Definitely keeping this around. Yum.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn't a lot of calories.  Get the 94% fat free and it's only 100 calories.
5540,5541,B000MXENCG,holy cheapness!,"I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container."
5545,5546,B000G671R8,Great snacking!,"These are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to ""plain old"" pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt/vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I've tried are delicious and a good bargain, too."
5546,5547,B0049S1YMM,Good stuff,"I found out about this spice blend in Dallas a few years back when I persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp.<br /><br />I like this Cajun spice for grilling fish. Recommend, but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least, or it will lose its flavor."
5548,5549,B004G94ZPW,Best Gummi Bears,I ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at Yogurtland. I was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews. But I received a perfectly packaged item. They were not melted and didn't have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears. They are my husband's favorite! We have been enjoying them since we received them and I'll be ordering more for events that are coming up.
5556,5557,B000Y4145M,Dogs loved them,I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.<br />They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.<br />My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn't buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.<br />I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion.
5557,5558,B0002G04PS,The name says it all!,"When we lived in CA we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi-chi grocery store. On am impulse we purchased them and made them that night. AMAZINGLY good. Made with a cube of butter so be warned! YUMMMY! We went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us. We have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down. What a pleasure to find them on our old haunt Amazon. Order, order, order so they will stay available here!"
5558,5559,B002UQEOA4,Not that great,The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.
5559,5560,B003YEX696,Spice Appeal thyme ground 64 oz jar,"How can you not like this at what great price they sold it at? I also split it up and sent some to my daughter.  It is one of my favorite cooking spices along with oregano, but I tend to make alot of stews and soups.  One must have spice is Thyme of course.  The oregano is for tomato sauce along with basil...  This was a deal."
5560,5561,B002LMUVJ0,It works!,"I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled ""weight loss tea"" .I'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you ""have"" to go."
5562,5563,B000LKZGNA,Best Tea,Fennel tea is the best herbal tea I have been able to find and Seelect is the best-tasting brand of those I have tried.
5564,5565,B001ASZV5K,Good stew.,"I actually, Gasp, tried this stew. I got to try this at the Texas Scottish Festival in Arlington earlier this year at the Caladonian Kitchen booth (then bought a few cans). The stew was quite good considering it comes from a can. Probably a fairer star rating would be 5 stars, if comparing just against other canned stews. I'm not entirely fair though, because I'm comparing it against stews I've had at irish restuarants. So, I have had better. But, still a good product in it's own right. I also liked the whiskey cake from the same company."
5566,5567,B001BZSDGQ,so so,"this egg pasta ingredient was ""powdered egg product"" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i don't like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  can't have it all i guess."
5567,5568,B0043P1O1M,9 Lives Chicken & Tuna Dinner,My 2 cats really like this cat food best of all! I have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available.
5570,5571,B008G37TFM,Heavenly Nectar,"This product is positively wonderful!  Use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic, but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch.  Apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat."
5571,5572,B00444ZAQM,great snack but strong flavor,i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice! i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the USA...these are great since there is no juice! you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess. i have been super happy with these. the flavor is pretty bold so I only eat 1-2 packs a week. I am going to try another flavor. i definitely recommend trying them! i love olives and this is a great idea
5576,5577,B005WINEYO,Delicious,"The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don't ever use any added sweeteners."
5577,5578,B0062Z60O2,My dog really loves the bones,"I needed something that would last a long time. My dog cannot stop chewing, she has to have something in her mouth. She eats anything that she can get in her mouth. rock, plants,wood chips, walnuts, apples, grasses. These work really good. I'm order somemore on line here, petsmart quit caring them. I also found out that pork in better for your dog. Instead of beef bone or anything with beef."
5578,5579,B0040WE938,Not as flavorful as I imagined,"I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap."
5579,5580,B004WR6BTQ,Yum Yum,"It's difficult to find 20 words to say about Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Milk Chocolate Toffee, other than DELICIOUS. They didn't last long. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
5580,5581,B000G1X45G,Yuban Coffee,"First, Yuban is my favorite coffee. To be able to buy a case and save is great. The coffee was in date, the seals on the cans were excellent, and the freshness of the coffee was excellent. I will definitely buy more Yuban coffee when I need it from Amazon groceries."
5613,5614,B005R981I2,Small but spicy,"The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard!"
5614,5615,B000LDOMT6,Best sunflower seeds I've ever had...,"My friend at work and I both eat sunflower seeds quite frequently. We always try new types when we find them. He came back from out-of-town with these a few weeks ago, and we're both hooked. They are definitely the best sunflower seeds either of us has had. Not only is the flavor fantastic, but the seeds themselves are top notch. First, they're HUGE. Second, there are surprisingly few broken or empty shells. Third, as of yet I've never had a mushy, foul-tasting seed. Sadly, we can't find anywhere around us that sells them, so I'm glad Amazon does. I'm really looking forward to trying the other flavors from this company as well. He brought more back from out-of-town today...I'm eating them now, and that is what prompted me to look online for a place to order from."
5618,5619,B0046LHDOK,"Good Piquillos, but Inadequate plastic packaging","These Piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package, though I thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll-top tin (like sardines are packed in).The peppers that survived the shipping were very good, lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor. However, one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs, making a huge mess."
5619,5620,B003FTFLZC,These are FANtastic!!,"Bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals, and have been waiting for them to be in stock here. I'll definitely buy more when they are available, as they are the best shortbread cookies I've ever had, my son agrees, and I love that they're basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself, with ingredients you can pronounce and won't kill you. :)  SO delicious!!!"
5622,5623,B001I8BONA,Super Fresh Coffee from Amazon,"I started getting this Folger's Half Caff coffee from Amazon because our small town stores don't always have it.  It comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag.  I like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and I have it automatically sent to the door so I don't have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out. What a boon for rural, small town people like me."
5625,5626,B0039W2Y6O,"Good product, wrong form",When Habanero is in powder form it doesn't taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It's almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat.
5626,5627,B007W44VZM,Hannah's Sausage,"Oh boy, These are a winner at my house.  We used to buy them locally, but they are no longer carried.  :(<br />My husband found these after trying other brands and these are the ones.  My son loves them as well.  They were delivered quickly and were fresh.  They said they almost had a pop to them.  We will definitely order these again.  They are heavy, so shipping was a little high, although we hope they will come back to W."
5627,5628,B000EUJLHE,Fabulous!,"I love Wasa Crisp 'n Light crackers! As their name suggests, they do have a very light and crisp texture.  They are still strong enough to support hummus or other spreads you may like to use.  However, they are also very delicious by themselves.  Sometimes you just want something to crunch without wasting a lot of calories on chips or other fattening foods, and a stick of celery isn't what you had in mind.  I keep these in the pantry all the time. They are low sodium and contain just 20 calories per cracker."
5659,5660,B000EDMENE,Toddler candy,"I think these are a bit boring (I like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice-enabled) but they do undeniably taste like peas, and my toddler begs for them (""peas! peas!""). I suspect she likes the crunchiness. I bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today. I think they'd probably be good in homemade trail mix, too."
5663,5664,B006J7TAHM,Scrumptious and beautiful - inside and out!,"Just wanted to compliment this company on their great, prompt service and the freshness of the cookies.. Bought them to give as a gift, and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol. I would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone.."
5664,5665,B007VXSSOE,Best sauce,"This is absolutely the best sauce for making Carolina BarB Q. I,ve looked for a long time and am glad that I finally found the best."
5665,5666,B000H23YC2,Best gravy mix on earth,"I have been using this Peppered Gravy Mix for years. I found it at a Wonder Bread discount store at least 15 years ago. It is the best you could ever make. I always made from scratch, but I believe this is even better. Unless I tell them, no one knows it wasn't made from scratch. So easy, and can use it for pork sausage, chicken, even ground beef. If you haven't tried it, you don't know what you are missing. Good price, best taste."
5680,5681,B003X0PUGI,Yummy,"This is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup. More pizzaz! I've been putting it on everything...... it's great on eggs and hash browns. I'm glad I bought 6 bottles. Shared some, and am going through the rest pretty fast. It's hard to find locally."
5682,5683,B000SATIG4,Davidson's Darjeeling Tea,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling."
5688,5689,B005JXGXDQ,One of my worst purchases ever from amazon,"I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money."
5689,5690,B00434J6YK,Delicious &  HEALTHY SNACK,"This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola ""thins""  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively"
5699,5700,B001QZW13W,Patchi Love,"My first exposure to Patchi choclates was in Abu Dhabi, where Patchi stores are found aplenty. Now that we are back in the States, Amazon is the only place I've been able to find Patchi. Hooray! The chocolates are as rich and delicious as I remember. If you have never enjoyed Patchi chocolates - do yourself a favor and buy some!"
5700,5701,B001FWXLX0,Bye-Bye Lucini,"My husband & I have always bought Lucini vinegar's but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since Lucini is expensive. I hit the jackpot right off with Cherry Republic's Sweet Cherry Balsamic. My husband & I use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor. This vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish. You cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price.....so we say bye-bye Lucini's Cherry Balsamic, now to find a great pear vinegar to replace another Lucini type we use: any idea's?"
5701,5702,B002RJD1J4,This is a wonderful chili!,We have been trying several chilis by small companies via Amazon and this one so far is our favorite.  I added some non-soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture.
5702,5703,B009WSNWC4,DELICIOUS,Purchased this product at a local store in NY and my kids and i love it. Its a quick easy meal. You can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min. and its ready to eat.<br />strongly recommend
5703,5704,B00683FY54,Delicious,"I really love this oatmeal, it is such a lovely treat. Quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks, a must buy!!"
5707,5708,B004PEDM7K,all Natural ~!!!!!!!!,Yay an all natural Kids Gum .  NO BHT Preservative ! No dangerous artificial sweetners .  Tastes fine and not bad for you !
5708,5709,B0012OTH8O,"Great flavor, too easy, excellent stew, back for more","While beef stew is almost too easy to make, I will admit to not being great at replenishing my seasonings supplies as needed. Because seasonings and spices/herbs are so expensive, I keep putting off purchasing them and the list to replenish them just keeps getting longer and longer. Eventually, I don't have anything with which to work. As such, I planned 2 6-qt crock pots of beef stew for over the holidays to always have something hearty and warm on hand for family as they came/went.  Lo and behold, when I finished cutting up all the meat and veggies and loaded them into the crock pots, I had nothing on hand to actually flavor those main ingredients. So, sent hubby off to the grocery store for a quick cheat...McCormick's beef stew seasoning packets. Of course I never told him how many to get, and as he wanted to 'do it right the first trip', he got a handful of them. Actually, in error, he grabbed the ones I'd never seen before: the ""SLOW COOKERS"" item. Man, oh, man! To heck with buying expensive, one-jar spices to keep on hand for this meal. This product worked perfectly! Open packet, mix with 1 1/3 Cups water, pour over ingredients in crock pot, mix it up just once and let the cooker rip for a few hours. The stew was excellently cooked, beef was so tender one needed a spoon with which to lift it otherwise it would break apart and the veggies were tender but not mooshy. It was more than flavorful; the au jus was not too thick and not too thin - perfect for sopping up with homemade bread that, unlike my spices, is always available in this house.<br /><br />I liked it so much, as did the family members, I'm back to purchase the pack of 12 here to keep on hand as well as the ""SLOW COOKERS"" for pot roast. I confess, for these two meals from now on, I'm being lazy, but quick and efficient. No serious measuring, no countless bottles of assorted spices, no mess and a tremendous result.<br /><br />NOTE: I did use 2 packets for each 6-qt slow cooker for although there is an easy recipe on the reverse of the packet, I don't measure my meat and veggies. I use what I have on hand and once the crock pot is at least 3/4 full, that's when I usually throw in my seasonings. The recipe provided would not be enough for my family. I didn't notice any additional recommendations on the packets indicating how much for what size slow cooker. I began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended 1 1/3 Cups of water (I used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it begins cooking), but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot, I just didn't think 1 packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the 'gravy'.  Therefore, I added an additional prepared packet to each 6-qt crock pot which gave me perfect results.<br /><br />This product uses only natural spices, no MSG, 0g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors.<br /><br />Edit: 1/2/10 - Another batch made for New Year's...this time, I reduced the amount of water per packet to 1 Cup (vs 1 1/3) and got thicker, more substantial 'gravy' vs  the usual 'au jus' consistency. The family liked it much, much better that way."
5709,5710,B001EQ5EJ6,Excellent Product,"My mother and I have been trying to find Ground Celery Seed for some time now.  We have not been able to find it anywhere locally so I decided to purchase this product online.  Hesitant to purchase food items online, I placed my order.<br /><br />The product arrived well packaged and undamaged.  It was sealed and fresh.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative to Celery salt, try this instead.  You do not get the salty flavor and a more robust Celery flavor.<br /><br />I just wish McCormick would package this in a smaller container again."
5711,5712,B002ANCCK6,"Great, high-quality cat food","I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review."
5723,5724,B0005ZWN0A,inexpensive meal,"The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles."
5724,5725,B000QAYREY,Yummy,Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
5725,5726,B003TIVBSU,very good price,"extremely good deal. i placed the order on tuesday, got the package on saturday. the packaging is very good (vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack). 1/2 vanilla bean is about a little over 50 vanilla beans. every grocery store i go (wegmans, whole foods, weiss etc etc) that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of 2 vanilla beans for typically $12. so if you buy 50 vanilla beans 2 at a time for $12 each, thats $300! so basically you're saving $272.31."
5794,5795,B006JG89BG,YUMMY!!!,"I have always liked the oskri bars... but these with the fennel in them are even tastier.  A great gluten free, no cane SUGAR, no cornsyup, treat for those being health conscious.  Also get a little protein to boot!  MMMmmmm MM!"
5795,5796,B002ALRK0U,I just like the plain ones,I don't really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  I'd just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today.

I always thought 3 year olds were picky eaters, but the twin boys beg me to heat up 2nds for them!"

5810,5811,B000FPWTHW,sooooooooooo easy,"I picked a can of this up on a whim at Big Lots for $1.30 and it is SO easy. I used one of those graham cracker pie shells, opened a can of this filling, and put it in the fridge. In four hours I added some lime zest and whipped cream...my friends did not believe how good it was for coming out of a can! I went back the next day and bought what they had left on the shelf. Highly recommended!!"
5811,5812,B006901054,FOUR OF FOUR CATS : PAWS (thumbs) DOWN,"One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.

5812,5813,B002MY3R70,Great tea,"This is a very very good tea, bearing the name Sibu. English tea is really nice and really really really really really good."
5813,5814,B000M2C536,Fazer Chocolate a delightful treat,"These chocolates are absolutely the best, smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture. Their an absolute MUST for any chocolate fan, I've never been a fan of milk chocolate, but these Fazer chocolates are the absolute exception! I highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do!"
5814,5815,B004R6B7F0,Uneatable,"I'm of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.<br /> 1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an ""instant buckwheat""<br /> 2. It tastes quite different than ""usual""<br /> 3. There is a strong metallic smell<br /> 4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper."
5815,5816,B00181SUH0,Omaha coffee in AZ,"When we lived in Omaha we fell in love with Pears coffee.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  For the price there is really no comparison.  We've tried other flavors, but always end up going back to colombio supremo.  We are now on direct ship every three months with Amazon.  Try it.. it's better than the grocery store options and less expensive."
5817,5818,B00778GG8S,Awesome tasting Tea!,Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn't cost a lot.
5818,5819,B002HFRYZ0,Premium Oolong Tea,"Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you'll do well to buy their products."
5826,5827,B000633O2C,Cat treats,"I want to give my cats as much variety as possible. They are family and they matter. Variety makes them happy. And their health & wellbeing are important. Giving them good, healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are. Unfortunately, I have to go online to find some treats as the stores don't carry the variety any more."
5827,5828,B004QDMY42,"Good, long-lasting flavor, a really good gum!","It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Peppermint with Ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in. And man, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5829,5830,B004IZN7H6,dog loves this,I would have to say that my dog is a picky eater. I have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves. She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona's happy so am I.
5831,5832,B002QWQH0M,Fragrant Jasmine Pearl Teas - Reminds me of Peet's Coffee,I moved to Las Vegas from San Jose last year and have been missing my Peet's Coffee Jasmine Downey Pearls tea.  When I saw this product I bought a shipment right away. I was not disappointed.  I love the individual silken sachets of Jasmine Tea pearls.  It is fragrant and wonderful tea. I will be buying it again.
5833,5834,B000FL0A9A,decaf,Works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush.<br /><br />Can not find decaf in stores.<br /><br />Can add other flavors and spices to  taste.<br /><br />Good for nutrition builder.
5840,5841,B001EQ5EJQ,Delicious!,"This is a delicious oil. The walnut flavor really stands out. We keep this oil in the refrigerator, to preserve freshness and taste. Definitely shake it well before each use. Everyone comments on how good it tastes whenever we use it. So, it's pretty universal in its appeal.<br /><br />We make a salad dressing using this walnut oil, blood orange vinegar and honey. The ratio of all ingredients is 1:1. E.g.:<br />- 1/4 cup blood orange vinegar<br />- 1/4 cup roasted walnut oil<br />- 1/4 cup honey<br />(adjust to your taste buds)<br />Mix with a blender or hand blender (or by shaking the jar, but a blender mixes much better, especially with the thick honey). Wow, is this a wonderful salad dressing!<br /><br />By the way, we use this blood orange vinegar: ""Cuisine Perel Blood Orange Vinegar"", which is available via Amazon. It has a wonderful flavor."
5871,5872,B004N5OPZE,weak,"I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent."
5872,5873,B008AHJZTM,Refreshing with zero artificial sweeteners,I enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners.
5874,5875,B001T5PGN6,Great stuff,"This product helped us tremendously. When our 2 year old daughter started day care, she wouldn't eat at the center and she began losing weight. We started her on Pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion. It worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining :). She loves the taste, especially the strawberry flavor."
5876,5877,B000FL0A9K,good to find decafe one,"Glad to find this for a birthday present as hard to find decaf ones in store.<br /><br />Makes good ice slushy and milk sakes cold.<br /><br />For those who can not take decaf, these are , and making them at home sure beats Starbucks prices."
5879,5880,B004S7MLQC,too much for too little,This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!?
5880,5881,B008YA1TNA,Good cuppa joe,"Strong, dark, intense. Strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman. It really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste. I just love it. It's good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain. Wish they made a decaf then I could drink it 24/7."
5881,5882,B006JGFYY6,Disappointed,"I love Taco Bell's grocery items, so I was excited to try this new rice. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. This is more of an imitation Spanish rice than a Mexican rice. It is tomato based, and very sweet. I expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning (cumin, garlic, etc).I cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time (90 seconds) and this came out very mushy and sticky, mostly clumping together. The flavor was too much for me, since I do not like sweet rice with my tacos. I would not try this again, and I would be hesitant to try another flavor."
5882,5883,B003KLSZGW,Delicious and Healthy Snack.,"If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth."
5908,5909,B001DIM8K8,Best Oatmeal Ever!,This is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating.  I make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are.  I use my small crock pot for the two of us.  I start with a 1/2 cup of oatmeal; add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla; add a 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water.  Place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in.  It will be ready in the morning when you are.  I let mine cook approx 10 hours.  My small crock pot has no settings- just off or on.  We love to add some brown sugar and dried blueberries or Craisins at the table.
5921,5922,B003IMPIEA,eleteamazon,"I really like this product to add to water so that I don't have to drink so much Gatorade and sweetened/acidic beverages.  I use this because I have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking ""free water"".<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it didn't arrive when promised and I didn't have it in time to take with me on vacation."
5922,5923,B00523NRVO,Perfect for my candy buffet!,I ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet. I am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly. They are individually wrapped and a true navy color. The packaging was great. Each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap. Love them!
5925,5926,B000BWO7XS,"An excellent, unique sauce","About ten years ago my wife and I stayed at a small resort near Domenical, Costa Rica.  Lizano was on every table in the restaurant.  We were quickly hooked.  Lizano goes great with eggs, beans, rice, tortillas, pork, fish, etc.  It's really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce.  We're on our second case now.  Give it a try."
5927,5928,B001O2IX8E,"be careful, moldy product, USDA now involved","My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).<br />to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations."
5960,5961,B001GM97BE,Great Chipotle Taste,We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.
5961,5962,B000EUC8EC,Nature's Logic,"The breeder of my puppy uses this, and I continued to feed with this supplement. Dog loves the taste, and makes her boring dry food more interesting- she gobbles it up. I notice her coat is beautiful. Good ingredients. I would recommend this."
5962,5963,B00063480E,Too Small,This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn't last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!!
5967,5968,B001NVEJKC,Terrible cheap chocolates for outrageous prices.,"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted."
5972,5973,B000I6PXLW,Chemical Taste Coffee,"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else."
5975,5976,B0028PHHLU,great value,"i love that i can get both flavors in one container. and at the asians store around where i'm at they go for about a buck, sometimes more. so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save"
5979,5980,B004067J7C,Highly recommended,"This mix is easy to prepare and very tasty. The only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute. The seasoning is excellent, very flavorful but not too spicy. Sometimes low-salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one. Excellent for vegetarians."
5980,5981,B00168O65A,worst cup of coffee I've ever tasted,"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!"
5982,5983,B00063480O,Good,My dog loves this flavor. Quality of cookie overall is very good. This particular smell drives him crazy!! On Amazon I get much chipper than in a store.
5986,5987,B001YXQ2V8,It's all about the convenience...,We live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it's easier and cheaper than making the trip.
5987,5988,B000I6PXLC,smells good....,"It definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average.... I can't say I taste the ""dark chocolate decadence"".... And it's not that strong but usually I like stronger tasting coffee."
5996,5997,B003SE52K8,"The ""paws down"" favorite among canned food!","My female Pixie Bob cat, Pawnee, is extremely finicky about her canned food.  She will touch nothing but Instinct's rabbit formula, and licks her plate clean each morning.  The Instinct brand is nothing but the best, whether it is a canned formula or dry."
6005,6006,B0064O79BO,"Super clean, crisp yeast. As close to lager from an ale as it gets","Just kind of yeast shopping one day. You're at the store and thinking, man, I really need to get me some new yeast. This sounded intriguing. An Alt strain, clean and rapid fermentation. Tolerant of cold conditions. In short, it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare. And it cleans up after itself. Only the Germans would have such a yeast. It's not like the California yeasts that are kind of fruity, or the British yeasts that just leave a mess. It's very German.<br /><br />You could easily pass this off as a lager yeast. I did a very simple wheat / pale malt light ale. 1.032 OG. 1.008 FG. Fermented at about 60-62 give or take. Grain to bottle in a week. I wasn't too concerned with flocculation or haze but that's just me. Cracked on the other day just to get a taste. Extremely clean. You can taste every single grain of the malt. I didn't hop it much. Maybe 15 IBU tops with magnum. Very nice lawnmower or pounding beer.<br /><br />Blow off tube is mandatory. Next project is a 1.062 American wheat. Blew out the airlock. I had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons. Very vigorous.<br /><br />If you want an absolutely crisp, clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55, this is it. Seems to really accentuate malt. Very nice yeast, but I like a little yeast profile so I don't know if I'm in love with it. Just impressed at how clean it is."
6006,6007,B00196497O,Energy booster!,"So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn't help.<br /><br />Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I'm not against it but I'm not a smoker and I've had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let's check Amazon and see what natural hemp products are available.<br /><br />First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you're interested, and it tasted like sand. It will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that's if I ever do. Then I tried this.<br /><br />I'm very honest in my reviews so I wouldn't recommend this if it didn't truly help. It's not a placebo-effect thing, either. I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me.<br /><br />The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels. I have done more around the house in the past few months than I've done in the past few years. I have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy hasn't gone away. I am a big and tall person so I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night, usually.<br /><br />Anyone who has depression/anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days. You get a heavy feeling like there's lead in your veins. If you've been through it then you understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I can say with 100% honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling. Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn't notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn't help, just don't buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me. I will take this supplement for the rest of my life, as far as I'm concerned. That's how much it has helped.<br /><br />I hope it works for you, too."
6019,6020,B007VF9ERW,spicy plum chutney,"I've tried most of the Virginia chutney Co. (VCC) product range and particularly like their spicy plum chutney. It is good with cold meats, salads, cheddar cheese, and curries"
6020,6021,B004FKKCWW,My favorite flavored green tea!,"I first tasted this at Petrossian.  I had ordered Green Tea and when I tasted it, I was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea.  I noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic.  It complimented the tea very well.  The tea is very light.  Au Bon Pain also carries this tea.  Try it out!"
6022,6023,B000FF77YM,Xylichew is great,"As a gum addict, I was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial-flavor/artificial-sweetener varieties. This gum is great. Now, the flavor comes from real peppermint, so it's not going to last as long as the fake stuff, nor it will be as mind-blowingly intense as some of the new super-flavored gums.  But if that's ok with you and you'd like to chew something that doesn't put weird chemicals into your body, this is for you.  It's expensive, sadly, but what can you expect? Buying it in bulk here helps."
6029,6030,B001E2FMLK,Ridiculous price,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.
6039,6040,B00092LTU4,Perfection in Cake Form,"I sampled this cake as offered from Biscoff 1 month ago and fell in love.  It is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee. The ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering, but you are able to taste each individual ingredient.  If you are looking for a great coffee or tea accompaniment, please give this cake a try!"
6041,6042,B002AUBIWW,"Just the right size for a yummy, crunchy snack","First, the ingredients list is wrong.  They are almonds, not cashews.  I don't have a recent bag (just ordered), but I have seen some with tapioca syrup and some with rice syrup listed in the ingredients.  My 6 year old son has tons of foods he needs to avoid, so these distinctions are important to us!  Luckily, he has been able to eat these and loves them.<br /><br />The pieces in the bag vary in size.  The most typical is about 1-1.5"" long by ~3/4"" wide.  There will be some loose crumbs in the bottom too.  It looks like they make them in a big pan and then cut them down.  I would compare them to bite-size (or 2-bite sized) granola bars.  It is just the right amount of sweetness added.  I love that these have a nice protein boost when I need to grab something and go."
6042,6043,B000NX103U,Great alcohol free rum flavor in sorbet,"I spent some time searching for an alcohol free rum flavor to make daiquiri sorbet, and LorAnn has produced the best flavor thus far (which tastes outstanding).  It blows away the competitors that I have tried.  Baking with it has not yet been attempted, but I imagine there would be similar results.  The price is quite reasonable for a 4 oz bottle, although it is much more so if multiple bottles are ordered (save on shipping).  It has natural and artificial ingredients; I would prefer it to be all natural, but that's a price I'm willing to pay for the flavor.  I predict this will remain my alcohol free rum flavor of choice."
6043,6044,B0044UO9FY,Candy look liked it was open & it is OLD. Do not Buy!,I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!
6045,6046,B008EE2PNO,Raw Organics going back to Paradise,Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.
6046,6047,B000H227BG,It's the best for Coffee,Put two tablespoons. in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha.  I have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online.  None are as good as this one.
6077,6078,B003KL64MY,Quick bread,"Great product! Love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of Christmas. Taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese. Have made it for co-workers who always rave about it. It's easy to make up, too."
6080,6081,B003SBZF1W,NOT Organic!!!,I bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic.  BEWARE!  The package shown in the photo is not an organic product.
6083,6084,B004PCVOIQ,Utterly Fabulous!,I absolutely love the Peanut Butter and Strawberry Kind bars! They taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
6084,6085,B004QXGUBU,These would be perfect for you if you are getting tired of the other potato chips!,"These potato chips are probably the best chips I flavor ever have. The spicy barbecue is the perfect mix of flavors! I have had tons of these chips and still they never get old. It fits one person per bag.  After a few chips, you will taste the spicy part.  Every time I see the bag, my mouth just waters.<br /><br />These would be perfect for you if you are getting tired of the other potato chips!<br /><br />Depending on the stores, sometimes shipping can be expensive.  If that is the case, most of the times you can find it at your local oriental groceries."
6085,6086,B007353LTM,DELICIOUS!!!,"oh man, i love this candy! it's super delicious, but its really not that sour. I'd always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each! =)"
6086,6087,B004741FYK,Master of Mixes just as good as scratch,"Our friends from Germany visited with us a few weeks back, and one of them adores Manhattans. She had them here 15 years back, and when I no longer could find a bottled mix locally, I ordered it from the Internet. This is my first experience with Master of Mixes, and the Manhattans turned out great, just as good as if I had made them from scratch. A great product!"
6087,6088,B0002QF0BQ,Just Great!,"I just love this Chili--it is beefier/chunkier than other no-beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding--much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than Hormel's in my opinion.  Goes great on a hot dog, a baked potato, good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins."
6088,6089,B000SSQXG4,ITS OK,"so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet"
6089,6090,B000EMM9DU,Good stuff BUT....,Packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box!
6090,6091,B007B11V6I,tasty drink mix,"Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink."
6091,6092,B0002IZD16,A New Staple,"Bull Dog's Chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen.  I've used it in everything: marinades, rice, stir fries, vegetables, etc.  I've also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces.  It also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce.  If I had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce.  Everytime I want to change a dish up a bit, I use chuno.  I've bought mine from somewhere else and didn't know it came in larger sizes.  The offering here is almost double the size, but it's also almost triple the price.  However, if the place I buy it from were to stop, I'd buy it here without fail.  I just wish they had the 50% less salt version."
6092,6093,B000VVP2JM,Oily to the touch,My dogs loved these...they were cheap too.  Only problem is they are oily to the touch...given they outside is great!
6093,6094,B0048B13NK,Tasty AND Healthy,"Arrowhead Mills Organic Savory Herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. I especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so I and my family can enjoy it without worry! The stuffing is very easy to prepare, but really adds to the meal. We use it all year long. Why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food?"
6094,6095,B001NOQ1RI,Pez,This was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff. He was surprised but really liked it.
6095,6096,B0000CERHH,Delicious Tea,"My daughter loved the little tin that came with her Adagio tea set so much that I got her a cannister of this for Christmas.  I think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much.  It really is delicious, and with green tea being so good for you, we drink it all the time.  All the products I've tried from Adagio have been wonderful."
6098,6099,B001LNZG9U,THIS PRODUCT IS ENRICHED WITH LEMON JUICE,"The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,""Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice"".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.<br /><br />I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with ""organic lemon juice"" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice."
6107,6108,B0082AC1MU,best almonds ever!,"They are very hard to find but whenever I do I try to stock up. Great flavor, perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy. Highly recommended."
6108,6109,B004L54ST4,Excellent quality,"I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses, even that labeled blackstrap, that I have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor. This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands."
6116,6117,B003L24000,Fabuloous on cat with bladder cysts,My cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine. i place a few drops in his food every week. btw he does not like it but tolrates it. at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it. a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok.
6117,6118,B0010PM49E,Basket Delight,"I bought this statehood gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends/family.  It's over priced so I will not buy this again.  The contents are mainly food made in China,  like graham crackers and taffy etc. One of the reasons I wanted it was for the beautiful XL ceramic coffee mug in this set.  Basket/item  is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping/cardboard for bulk, so there is not that much in there.  It's fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you resided in.  Overall I was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for China made items and some items listed in the product were NOT included in this particular gift.  ( items vary per set )"
6118,6119,B002HP2XCO,best tasting chocolate beverage,"Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.<br /><br />Plus it is organic!<br /><br />It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.<br /><br />I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.<br /><br />This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere."
6121,6122,B000EQ2LLQ,Saba,"I am a Saba fan.  It is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings, dips, etc is without equal.  Use your imagination for this fruity/astringent addition.  The only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution."
6122,6123,B000WGFTSU,Very good Vanilla,This is the second time that I ordered this product and I've been very happy with it.
6123,6124,B0026LJRX2,Other brands don't compare!,"Found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them.  Their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name.  I got original, ranch and sizzlin bacon - they're all great!  When my grocery store told me they got Bigs as a one-time deal, I was happy to find them at Amazon.  If you're a seeder you've gotta try these."
6124,6125,B0028FRZMG,Flamingo?,"The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and ""painted"" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  They'll be ""OK"" to set out on the candy buffet, but they won't be the eye-catching item we'd anticipated when we ordered."
6125,6126,B0007OVXSC,freakin rocks man!!!!,"Licorice freakin rocks man, i like to take the licorice ropes and choke my self till im blue, then chew my way out. man this stuff is like crack, i just want roll it up and smoke it like a big fatty."
6126,6127,B000NMHXZ0,Great Product & Service,Excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. Was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.Will buy again. Thank you.
6127,6128,B003U9TAH2,Best tasting protein power around.,"I've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
6130,6131,B000HI33AO,MMM + MMM = YUMMY,So I was doing my daily grocery shopping on Amazon and I was like awwww yeah there are some Rice Krispie treats sure can just make them in the kitchen but then you have to clean the spoon and wash the stove and then find some saran wrap in the kitchen to keep them more yummy for the next days....instead order these its simple a nice size treat that will give you plenty of treats for one day...high five to snap crackle and pop you guys rule. have a nice day k
6131,6132,B000634M5U,Perfect Nutrition,This product is perfect for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. His stools are very regular and healthy. My Vet was very pleased to know I picked this product instead of a regular store brand. It's all natural and my puppy loves it. :)
6132,6133,B0064R7FLA,Great vendor! Quality product.,"Flour type 00 is better than regular flour.  Whether frying it or baking it, dough maintains softness and pliability.<br />I like it a lot."
6136,6137,B005SFSNZG,Too Sweet,I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money.
6137,6138,B001SAXWII,Good drink mix if you alter the directions a little.,"I have been to New Orleans at one of the Pat O Briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant.  The key is  that the mix  makes twice as much as it says it makes, so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery.  So either use half as much powder or twice as much water, mix with your favorite rum(what they use), vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane."
6138,6139,B003JMH0FY,Heavenly!,"This is the best quality Chamomile tea I have ever tried! This is only 1 oz. so it's a little pricey, but I will buy it again anyway, because the quality is out of this world. You will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon, but the first one is the best, of course. I like mine strong. Chamomile fans will love this tea."
6140,6141,B001FA1LXO,"Berres Brothers Coffee Breakfast Blend (3Pkg, Ground)",Love this coffee.  Have bought this flavor and several others in the past.  Recommend it to everyone.  Will continue to buy it as long as I can afford to.<br />The French Vanilla is excellent as well!
6141,6142,B007Z5C4DO,Snyder of Hanover Honey Mustard & Onion Pieces,"These are a great value, great size snack to have, or even share, great snack..... yummy.  Haven't tried other flavors, but just might have to."
6142,6143,B00370XQ5G,Not really 4 million scovilles,"This hot sauce has an excellent taste, unlike most of Dave's Insanity sauces. I put 6-10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot. Like the other reviewer, I'd put it at about 1 million SHUs. Having eaten fresh bhut jolokia (ghost) peppers which are supposed to be 1 million SHUs, I'd compare it to those.<br /><br />4 million SHUs would mean that the sauce is 25% pure capsaicin. That would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume."
6152,6153,B003CMZE1S,onion soup mix,really not much I can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us. we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever. then tried this well we will never go back to canned again. well worth the money will be buying more.
6153,6154,B006FZI2UY,Just Awesome!!,These things are seriously beyond delicious!! Just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet. A perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days :)
6155,6156,B0085NFX2O,AMAZING!!!!!,"Grilled out brats, chicken, and burgers for the entire family yesterday.  Covered all of it with Country Bob's seasoning and all purpose sauce!  The family loved it.  Best sauce available!!  Can't wait to use it on my steaks tonight!"
6156,6157,B004HBM5NI,Love this tea,I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
6157,6158,B000CSBVGC,good deal when cheaply priced...,i got it for under 7 dollars shipped...  i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal.
6158,6159,B002EZ1MGA,A Great Cuppa Tea:),"The company has been around for over 160 years, is the company that started PG Tips and started and owned Red Rose tea so you know you're dealing with a quality tea company. The flavor is very similar to PG Tips to me; but stronger. It's definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it's strength and you'll be happy that the milk doesn't 'water it down' in any way. With milk you'll still enjoy the full tea flavor; the milk only enhances the taste. It is a very strong tea, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it is a high quality, full flavored tea at an economical price. PG Tips is still my favorite but since I can't find it in my area but can find Brooke Bond Red Label at my local WalMart I'm a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to PG Tips...maybe it's just me, but I taste the similarity.  You won't regret trying this tea!"
6160,6161,B007J6GGII,True Bacon Flavor,"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Bacon"" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that I'm going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many ""bacon fanatics"" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous ""Jelly Belly"" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />CFH"
6162,6163,B002GURBZ4,The best edible glitter,I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake.  This one was by far the most stunning.  The other silver went on grey (not that appetizing) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement.  Highly recommended.  Nice fast delivery too.
6169,6170,B003BN7DLW,"Very tasty product, but please note one odd issue","This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product I'd order it again.<br /><br />One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.<br /><br />Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasn't truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st."
6170,6171,B00579IZMY,DELICIOUS,This was a gift from my Lil Sis.  Awesome.  Great flavor.  Can taste berries and rhubarb.  I love it.  Most likely will order more.
6171,6172,B004553S6E,Smelled horrible and gave the dogs the runs,"If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again!"
6172,6173,B000JMBEAO,Vimto,"Vimto, love it. Fekkin expensive here though!<br />That's the problem with no longer living back in Blighty, stuff like Vimto becomes much more difficult to get."
6173,6174,B0041HNGGS,Great intro to spherification,"It's true you also need a decent scale (I used <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OKR89G"">Jennings CJ300 300g X 0.1g Scale</a>).  I tried the Caviar Cointreau recipe [...] and everything worked perfectly on the first try (it's fast too - under 20 minutes & I'm sure faster once you get the hang of it).  It's fun & very easy to make (a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids).  The kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it'll be good for 40+ uses."
6175,6176,B000634IIG,Healthy and Safe,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.<br /><br />I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout."
6176,6177,B001HBI29M,Needs more lemon flavor,"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again."
6177,6178,B004NDFCSU,Cat LOVES this stuff.,"Now I know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now. Believe me, I have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word ""natural"" in the title, and she is not having it. She won't get the benefit of the food if she won't eat it. So when I noticed she was eating all of her food when I put this in front of her, I decided to stick with what is apparently working. This is still premium food, formulated for my twelve year-old's needs, and she really, really likes it. 'Nuff said."
6178,6179,B002RJD2XY,Cook up to be whole beans in a jiffy,"These are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup, or just to have any size portion of black beans right away. As they are dried, they last forever, and you can have any portion size you want. With a little water and microwave, they perk up to give you really good quality black beans. I like these better than canned black beans, and I don't have any more at any time than I want. Adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up. You can't do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place. I haven't calculated the price out, but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you aren't buying any water. Would be perfect for camping food as well."
6179,6180,B003JPHDIK,great new twist on old favorite,"I was born and raised on the east coast  Trenton - New Jersey ). I have loved Tasty-Kakes my whole life , so its a great present to find some mew flavors or twists on old familiar receipes."
6180,6181,B005GHVL1O,Dr Pepper,"I got this product for my husband beause he loves Dr Pepper. It came before the date it was suppose to arrive on. He loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt, he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore. The item was packed good and safe and everything was there. NO COMPLAINTS!"
6183,6184,B004JQTDUO,GREAT COFFEE,"ESPECIALLY AS WE GET OLDER, THE LINING OF OUR STOMACH GETS MORE SENSITIVE TO HARSH CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES.  LOW ACID COFFEE IS A COMMON SENSE SUBSTITUTE THAT LOSES NO AROMA OR TASTE IN THE PROCESS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
6184,6185,B000UOFW9K,Awesome Taste but....,I received my 2 cases of Rice Works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price BUT in every single bag (24) the chips were crunched/smashed into little pieces so i guess I have 24 bags of salad toppers or ..... but not chips.
6197,6198,B002GWHCLK,My Wife's Coffee,I make for my wife capuccinno in the mourning befor she goes to work.<br />And I use flavored coffee in the esspreso machine and it is hard to find<br />Hazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavored<br />beans. This 5pound bag from Coffee Bean Direct was an excellent price and<br />the flavor was very good also. A great choice for paople who grind their<br />own coffee beans.
6211,6212,B0062I862I,Flavorful brew with aromatic notes.,"Anyone who knows Yaucono will like the ""new"" packaging of mylar-laminated plastic.  I wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper?<br /><br />If you have not had this very rich Puerto Rican coffee, you must sample it and then buy in bulk.  Juan Valdez might have a good bean, but the Puerto Ricans do it better."
6213,6214,B0001WW41A,heavy duty!,"This is a hefty roll of mylar! The 50"" width allows more coverage, obviously, but the 1 ml thickness is what's really nice.  It's not flimsy!"
6214,6215,B0025UA5I0,Moist but bland,"This cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist, but bland.  Compared to the new deluxe Duncan Hines version of German Chocolate cake, this is not impressive.  It will do when you're craving something different from regular chocolate cake, though."
6215,6216,B000NY31I6,Creme of the crop!,This Creme Brulee is as good as any homemade! Why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box! Easier to make too!
6218,6219,B004RDNGSY,This does not taste at all like Wild Bill's,"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!"
6219,6220,B001EO776Q,will not but again,"I blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say it's a dark blend but it's not even close to a dark roast I buy at stores.  In the end, I have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it's OK."
6227,6228,B005OBHPUS,Brachs Manderin Orange Slices,I ordered this for my Mother-in-law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives.  She is really enjoying this product.
6228,6229,B0005Z6EUU,Very fresh and tasty,Very fresh and tasty SOFT buns that go well with my Omaha steak burger patties.<br />They store well.
6229,6230,B0084B6CV8,Eh.,"Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much.<br />...(cough)<br />So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they'd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!<br />Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly/gummy, but don't expect much."
6230,6231,B001SAYI2W,So good I eat it straight from the jar!,"I haven't ordered this item YET, so I can't speak to the customer service angle.  However, I have purchased this product at a local specialty food store that sadly no longer carries it and I must say it's one of the five greatest things I have ever put in my mouth.  It's so great I have literally eaten it straight from the jar! If you've never had lingonberries, they are crimson red, roughly the sized of blueberries, and taste a lot like sweetened cranberries, only better.  They don't have the acrid taste that cranberries sometimes have, but I will say that if you dislike cranberries, this may not be your favorite thing.<br /><br />Of all the lingonberry products I've tried - jams and preserves - the Fellix Preserves are my very favorite.  The berries are whole or in halves, the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth, rich and has a dense texture.  The flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit, but it's also great on bagels or english muffins or toast.  And although I haven't tried doing it, I've heard this is a great product to use in baking - this would be great in a berry muffin, or as a complement to game dishes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!"
6233,6234,B000E1HVW0,Family Favorite,"I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think."
6246,6247,B000E65OF6,a very definite five stars!,"Welcome to heaven, Judy.<br />What?<br />Yes, you have arrived.<br />What?<br />You are asleep now, thanks to Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.<br />But I don't remember going to sleep.<br />My point exactly. That's why I call it heaven.<br />But who are you?<br />I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.<br /><br />What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup--mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.<br /><br />Meanwhile, pick up the box--how many times now--and read the the words.<br />""100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free.""<br />""a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses...""<br />""...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world...""<br />'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.' Emily Dickinson<br />Ingredients: Chamomile, spearmint, lemon grass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn berries, and rosebuds.<br /><br />But before I take my cup back to bed, I look at the last panel of the box. There's papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire, Mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another, taking them to bed. Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.<br /><br />I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping. I have learned that if I sip my usual slow sipping, I will fall asleep only halfway finished. That is how efficacious the tea... really... is....."
6261,6262,B000KOSDY6,awesome  corn cake,This product is so great.  My daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free!!  so she can actually have this!!!!!<br />Not bad for 100 calories per serving!!!!!<br />This will be a great dish to take for Thanksgiving dinner.
6282,6283,B000MIFPM8,Great for lunch!,"I've been a fan of this stuff for years.  Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don't feel like going out for lunch."
6286,6287,B002ONWAWC,Unimpressed,"When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didn't happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival."
6287,6288,B0042GWL5A,sees candies,i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased . the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well. the candies were fresh and delicious. would get again.
6289,6290,B00061U6AW,Don't order these in the summer!,"Speaking as another Texan, I think the first rule for these delicious treats is to NOT order them during spring or summer. In fact, your safest bet is to ONLY order them in the dead of winter.  LOL!  As long as you do that, be prepared for a truly amazing treat!  This package comes with 12 bite-sized delicacies.  The chocolate is high-quality, the nuts are crunchy, and the overall taste couldn't be better.  Definitely worth the price!"
6295,6296,B000FFQ4FK,1st rate from someone who knows better,"This will be a short review (for me).<br /><br />I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur, so for me to give a tea 5 stars... well this is a first for me in an Amazon review.<br /><br />Like other reviews of this product, it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot; delicate, thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus.  The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone."
6296,6297,B002SVAYGY,Too Expensive on Amazon,"I only use C&H Bakers Sugar for all my baking needs and I go through it FAST with a lot of baking. I looked on Amazon to see if I could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings. At the grocery store, one 4lb carton costs less than $5, so to get three of them, it would cost $15 or less. Here on Amazon it is $28 PLUS $12 shipping. That totals $40 for a $15 product. Yep, that's almost 3 times more expensive than if I just purchase it at the local grocery store. I love Amazon and was really shocked to see this price. This is a definite NO THANKS, I know better than to purchase this item here!"
6299,6300,B001D6F1PY,The Best for Risotto,We've been trying various rices including Aquarello Carnaroli and this Vialone Nano is by far the best. It's very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we've tried.<br /><br />Be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package - the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well.
6302,6303,B0046H89Z6,It's not bad- matches discription!,"Very crunchy and salty, just like described. I can also tell they use a lot of artificial  color. Not the best caviar. Might be really good for sushi!"
6303,6304,B000X905WQ,Head Over Heals for this Treat,"My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that, since these treats are all natural, they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats, making them extra healthy.<br /><br />The price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can't beat the quality."
6305,6306,B004DP0D32,Best new flavor on the market,"These seeds are awesome, good size with the perfect amount of spice.buffalo to ranch flavoring.  I've only been able to find them here locally at 2 or 3 other gas stations, ordering them via Amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly 4-5 dollars buying the box."
6316,6317,B003ZT61QK,Vanilla Nut Cafe - favorite flavor,"The Maxwell House International Coffee - Vanilla Nut Cafe - is absolutely my favorite flavor!  Seems to be extremely difficult to locate now, though.  Last purchase was made through Amazon and hoping it will become available again soon!"
6317,6318,B00434BZ7G,Not as good as regular,"I couldn't really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. It's OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price."
6318,6319,B000084EKQ,Pleasing finicky cats #3,"My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now."
6319,6320,B007R8XGJK,Sooo glad I found this!,"Excellent Energy drink, I drink one-a-day before I go for my daily walk, gives me a nice boost!  I like the taste, may take a few too get used to it!  No jitters just a boost!"
6321,6322,B0043320ZS,Chopped nuts,"The description of the item is ""small pieces, diced.""  I would call them chopped. They're basically what you'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box."
6322,6323,B000084EKW,one great big huge high-five--from my cat !!!,"My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish & Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole & Shrimp Feast. Very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too."
6325,6326,B004RUN2Q8,Great Oysters!,"Great oysters, fast shipping. Can't find them local so I took a chance and they were GREAT! They were frozen when I got them and package was well packed."
6326,6327,B001AW9PTO,Misleading reviews,"I was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough. But I gave it a shot anyway. I don't know if it was because I ordered a different flavor(Teriyaki) or if I just got lucky. Nonetheless, I think these jerky strips are some of the best I've ever had. I will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty, but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice won't fix. As per being tough, I munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as I opened it. I just couldn't stop myself, they were that good. For all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear. So for those of you out there that are real jerky fans, this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />**Update** I did a little research because I was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty. I looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors. Both the Original & Peppered contain 650mg of sodium, the Wood Smoked had 570mg, and the Teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium. So if you thought the others were too salty, or are worried about this jerky being too salty, try the teriyaki. I highly recommend it. It's not too salty, just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki, but still nice pepper flavor as well."
6368,6369,B004CH6QG4,Sorry...,I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.
6369,6370,B000084EKL,Great product,"This is the only food my cat will eat.  If I buy another variety or brand, it sits in her bowl until it gets stale & I throw it out."
6370,6371,B000084EKM,Our finicky eater's favorite food,"This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.<br /><br />The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.<br /><br />It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well."
6371,6372,B000084EKO,Not any different than regular Friskies,"I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead."
6372,6373,B000084EKA,Not their best...,"I think 9 Lives does a better job on this variety than Friskies.  Or I should say my cat does.  Friskies doesn't look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesn't like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version."
6373,6374,B000084EKB,Great food!,"This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others."
6374,6375,B000084EKC,Great food for all cats!,"According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2-3 times a month because it's fish - not exactly his favorite food.  It's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates."
6375,6376,B000084EKD,Needs improved,"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
6376,6377,B000N9HXZ8,Very Very Good,"I'm so glad to shop at Amazon.com it have everything you need,I<br />love getting my season from ""Marshalls Creek Spices"" it fresh, and<br />taste, and good try it you will like it I'm so glad to know about<br />amazon.com I wouldn't know about ""Marshalls Creek Spices""<br /><br />  Thank You<br />  Miss Andernette Anderson<br />  God Bless"
6378,6379,B0046HLQ42,HUGE RIPOFF,This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don't make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere.
6380,6381,B000084EKG,Awesome food!,"This is my cat's favorite one.  He just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it.  I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you'll be glad you did!"
6382,6383,B000084EK8,Not the favorite in our house,"Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it."
6383,6384,B000084EK9,Four cats love it.,"At 60 years old I have had the care of cats my entire life.  Presently have four cats, three of which were ""barn cats"" and one came out of the woods and adopted us.  These cats love and gobble up Friskies Pate varieties ""Mariner's Catch"", ""Sea Captain's Choice"" and ""Ocean Whitefish with Tuna"".  I also serve as a ""foster parent"" for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties.  The ""Salmon"" pate is very rich and I use it only as a special treat.  Incidentally, my cats always reach great age on Friskies.  Our cat ""Kitten"" died at 23 years old. She jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the Vet asked what food we used all of those years.  It has always been Friskies...dry and wet pet foods.  I find it is the best value and maintains our pet's good health right to the end.  The youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and I have have had 28 cats as permanent pets, and countless foster pets over the years."
6386,6387,B00724ENGY,Wrong hat and misleading description,"Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by ""Godiva 4 Pack"", they mean ""4 pieces of candy""!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!"
6387,6388,B00161O1YS,Taste good but gave me gas =(,"These little taffy's are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn't let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldn't eat the taffy some days and would be fine. All it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start.<br /><br />This information may be useful since its not on amazon. Sugar free does not = carb free.

6389,6390,B00811X8NQ,low calorie and my dogs love!,I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack!
6390,6391,B00348J434,handy for cooking Asian recipes,Just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes.  Glad to have this in my pantry.  Flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes.  Product delivery was great - just as expected.
6392,6393,B000YSQ9XU,Delicious honey,"This is terrific honey.  What more can one say about it?  There was a great price when I got it, too -- much better than at the local supermarkets."
6393,6394,B000084EK4,Great beef look,"This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."
6394,6395,B000084EK5,Family favorite - looks like steak!,This is my cat's third favorite food.  It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!
6395,6396,B000084EK6,Great food!,"This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
6396,6397,B000084EK7,What's in this?,"This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite."
6397,6398,B003CB0VAI,High Quality Jerky.,"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky."
6404,6405,B008D8A9P2,Absolutely one of the best Hard Candies  available,I am always on the  lookout for good old fashioned candy. Funny I do not even have a sweet tooth. However I really appreciate a quality candy. I picked up one these purely for the fantastic packing they come in. After just one taste it was obvious that the company has put love and care into producing these candies.  If you are looking for unique smooth and delicious old fashion candy look no further. Highly recommended.
6405,6406,B004NNDDV8,Very flavorfull,"If you like a lot of flavor in each bite, this is it.  A little messy to handle but worth the fuss!!!"
6407,6408,B001BYEFDM,quick delivery,it's difficult to describe herbal type pills. with no quick results it takes blind faith really. i reckon these are ok? i got what i ordered quickly
6408,6409,B0041SI8H4,Earl Grey Tea + + +,This tea is full of flavor without bitterness.  No additions needed.  You will not be disappointed.  Do not try this Earl Grey if you do not like bergamot.
6410,6411,B002AYEBQI,"ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems",Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.
6416,6417,B002YD0AFQ,What happened to Claxton Farms Quality???,"I've eaten Claxton Farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them.  I thought I'd be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as I know I'd use them.  This time the quality control went out of town.  Lousy.  Absolutely disappointing.  Of the 5 loaves, one was good,  Two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and I ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping,  totally unable to slice.<br /><br />the last two loaves just the opposite, they were runny.  When taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over, again, had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes.<br /><br />Claxton Farm might have sold out or fired the Quality Controller.  Awful quality after all these years.  Do NOT order from Claxton as you don't know what you'll get.  They lost a long time customer with me."
6420,6421,B001UOY7X6,Valrhona Manjari 3kg,"This is simply the best chocolate I have ever tried. In general, 3kg packages are much better than 70g Valrhona's. If I had only tried 70g Valrhona Manjari, I would have never known how good it can be. Try the 70g to see which one you like and then buy 3kg package(it will be 3 times better). It has around one year of best before left when you buy it(which is enough, beleive me)...<br /><br />Great for cooking and sublime for eating."
6422,6423,B000OIT8T2,Innocence lost,"So, I moved from Europe to the US, I settled in my apartment etc, and after a week or so I decided that I wanted some candy. I went to the supermarket and started looking for some M&M's. Then this weird *red* bag caught my eye and I thought, hah!, this country is funny, they put an 's' instead of an 'm' on their M&M's here, and the bag is all different too.<br /><br />So I took one bag home to try it. I grabbed a handful of the presumed M&M's and ... what a surprise. This was obviously not what I had bargained for, and I considered ditching this wrong purchase, but instead I figured I'd give this weird stuff another chance at some other time.<br /><br />Do you realize that my mortal soul could _still_ have been saved, at that point ??<br /><br />It was only in the next few days that the addiction set in. I found myself longing for more of that flavor when the bag was through; I wouldn't have reckoned at first, that I would actually buy many more of these bags on purpose.<br /><br />Now my willpower has been eternally challenged. My stomach will never be like before. My jaw is numb from the endless compulsive chewing. And I can just feel my teeth desintegrating right when I take another dose. Why do I forever ache for that soothing acidic taste ? They're so delicious they ought to be outlawed !"
6434,6435,B001SB4I80,Much better deal nowadays!,"The add on program makes this a great deal for a natural, very tasty sugar.<br /><br />You can add to any order over $25 or buy 8 (like I did) and have all 16# delivered free. Either way an outstanding value!<br /><br />There are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar. I use in my coffee and making bread. Use 1 to 1 instead of ""white"" sugar for your needs. You may find that yeasts will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar.<br /><br />The zip-loc bag does not seal all that well. So I store in a quart mason jar in the dark cupboard. Each bag is sightly more than one quart. The balance is added to the sugar bowl.<br /><br />Give this sugar a try. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
6436,6437,B0025UOODW,Absolutely Scrumptious,"I buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water, and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one I have found. This particular flavor is incredibly true to a real red grapefruit flavor, yet sweet and powerful. What's great is that the flavor works whether I want just a little or a lot, depending on how sweet I want my soda to be on any given day. It's comparable to Squirt / Fresca, but honestly I think the actual flavor is much richer and more satisfying. If you like the taste of grapefruit even a little bit, you won't be disappointed."
6437,6438,B000R4DWC2,"A vey good sampling of goat cheeses, but not Great","I love goat cheeses and buy them on a regular basis.  A lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh Chevre.  I have purchased this selection by iGourmet for both myself and for others as gifts.  The reactions from my friends have been mixed.  They all enjoy the harder chesses, such as the Goat Cheddar and the Ibores.  However, some people don't like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.  Still, I wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cow's milk such as the goat's milk Cheddar and Gouda.<br /><br />As for as price goes, this is a surprisingly good value.  You are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than I have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here.  One of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses.  Instead of the cheddar they received the Cypress Grove's Midnight Moon.  I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.  Overall I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses, I just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423603680"">Goat Cheese</a>"
6440,6441,B002OLK5JO,Heartier And Better Than I Expected,"This soup is like a combination of vegetable, lentil and Spanish rice soups.  It has a slightly gelid texture, though I never add as much water as I should.  4.5 stars to be exact."
6441,6442,B000QB0WUG,Yummy,Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
6442,6443,B0053PO8U0,"Not real veggies, but a really good 'better' than chips snack","It wouldn't be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack I personally can't think of a better one on the market.  The portion size for 130 calories is absolutely gluttonous.  One portion is equal to 38 straws.  That is quite a bit of snacking for 130 calories.  These are crispy and taste great.  There is no trans fat, no preservatives, and kosher certified.  The single serving does have 7 grams of total fat and 11 carbs.  Eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option.  I have lost 92lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and I am happy to say this brand of Veggie Straws has helped me along the way."
6444,6445,B007GUSZWC,Best Kitty Cookies Ever,My kitties love these. Other Goodlife treats are good. Kitties adore these. Beg and plead for them. I think they must be addictive for cats.
6445,6446,B000633WEW,A Big Ripoff!,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"
6449,6450,B004FDF7YW,I'm somewhat distressed.,"I have to add that I've not baked with this yet. But when I received this I was aghast at the ingredients. Perhaps I didn't read it well because the ingredient list is right there... I guess I simply expected alcohol & vanilla beans, maybe sugar, in an ""ol' timey"" product.<br /><br />I'll update this once I use it."
6450,6451,B000FNEX50,Very Good!,"I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again."
6509,6510,B001VL64SO,12 gallon plastic fermenting pail,"I love it! It's strong enough to start at least 10 gallons of wine, yet light enough to be flexible, very important for pushing the lid down inside for a sanitizing solution. Future models should come with calibrations so you know how much liquid is inside but that was easy to overcome with a sharpie and a measuring container."
6511,6512,B000EZOO30,the best,"I got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries.  It rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good.<br /><br />I'm now half way through my second jar of Tone's, which is consistently excellent.  It has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli.  It is way better than raw garlic cloves.  They must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder.  If you have doubts about your current garlic powder, smell it.  If it doesn't have a strong garlic smell, it's just white powder.  Get this Tone's and you'll get your delicious food back."
6514,6515,B005O8BLLU,"Love, love, love","My 9 1/2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months.  I have tasted it, and it's delicious.  It's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack.  The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C."
6518,6519,B008OV8RE8,Passed the Taste Test,"No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children."
6520,6521,B003JYEL2W,Community is the best,"I'm usually a caffeine guy, but I had to switch to decaf while my wife is pregnant.  This is definitely the best decaf out there - full flavored, smooth, and very aromatic.  It's the best!"

6523,6524,B004KUEQUG,Yum!,I got this product a while back. It was very delicious. I love trying to cook Korean food. I would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking Korean food. The hot pepper paste came in perfect condition.
6525,6526,B000I077RG,Very watermelon flavored!,I love all of Joray's flavors. Watermelon is my favorite! Joray's fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks.
6527,6528,B00504SLMK,Great hard sour candy,"These are delicious.  They have the same consistency as a Spree or Runt, and they are sour all the way through.  I'm sure I'll be ordering some more."
6530,6531,B0034W0X0I,Works great in my espresso machine,My wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great.  She says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
6531,6532,B00008O36H,Great for our dogs!,"Our two Golden Retrievers have been on Beneful Weight Control now for at least 3 years. We didn't see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention.  They love it and both have lost considerable weight -- both were considered ""obese,"" but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight.  My only real complaint is they stopped selling it (at least around here) in the larger 40-50lb bags.  Now you can only find these 31lb bags but the price is the same.  We go through about 2 bags a month, so it's a little pricey."
6537,6538,B0031YKDO0,Love these!,"This is one of my favorite potates dishes but I always have a tough time finding them in my local supermarkets. So, like usually, I go to Amazon and sure enough, they're available at a much lower price in a shipment of 6 boxes. As I know they'll be gone in no time (my family loves them too) I put them on automatic delivery. No more searching the supermarkets, love it!"
6539,6540,B0045AW84M,Surprisingly tasty,I was amazed at the actual taste of this product . . . the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good.  They have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good.
6540,6541,B003DKY5R8,Fresh Unsweetened Tea On Demand,"I purchased a Keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a French press full and pitching half of it.  I use it to make unsweetened iced tea.  With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k-cups, it's great to have one with the good, clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea.  I use the largest setting and then add about 1/2 cup of cold water to the Pyrex liquid measuring pitcher.  With the addition of water, it cuts the strength to the proper consistency.  I don't bother with all the glasses with ice and then brewing over ice.  I just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher.  Good stuff."
6554,6555,B001OKI1U6,The BEST dog food!!,"I have two Chihuahuas and they absolutely love their little bites!  The ingredients are the best quality available .. organic chicken, flax seed, nutra-drops, and TONS of vitamins and minerals!  The best part about this food is that toy breeds can be on this from the time their little puppies til they're full grown- for life!  Try finding another dog food that does that!  This is a MUST if you have a toy breed dog.  It helps balance their glycemic index even at the most stressful periods of time.  Overall, it is just a really healthy food that will make your dog look and feel beautiful inside and out!"
6555,6556,B00959DMWK,the best tasting turkish delight,"I ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious .I took it to my parents house for my sister's birthday among her gifts which I also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this Turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and I told them amazon go there they have everything,amazon thank you as allways bringing us International flavors without leaving our homes."
6556,6557,B003AYL9NU,Contains CHICKEN,"Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page. This is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor.<br />The ingredients are as followed for the Low Calorie variety<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, oat fiber, chicken, natural chicken flavor, dehydrated carrots, organic flaxseed, cranberries, apples, cinnamon, parsley, chia seed, carrageenan (natural seaweed extract), l-carnitine, peppermint, l-ascrobyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), green tea extract (decaf)."
6577,6578,B002BRC562,The best of the energy chews!,"I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones."
6615,6616,B005GLNKOQ,Makes a perfect soup base!,"I had gotten a box of Malher Hilachas style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a rainy day - well, today it rained. I mixed the package with water, added rice, some peppers, onion, chicken and potatoes and let it simmer. My entire family just loved it - even my picky grandson! Now, I want to find more!!!!"
6616,6617,B003Y5VGDS,Better than it looks...,"The box is very impressive. So I had high expectations (especially when it comes to chocolate).<br />The combination of chopped up nuts and small pieces of dark chocolate is brilliant - unlike anything I have tasted before. Amazing flavor - somewhere between velvet (chocolate) and crispy (nuts).  Made me feel almost relaxed... weired...<br />Yesterday, I had it for breakfast, instead of granola, with milk. It was really good. I didn't crave food and I didn't snack until mid-afternoon. I am impressed."
6617,6618,B001LG945O,Serve On the Rocks,"I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the ""The Switch Orange Tangerine"" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about ""The Switch""... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with ""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can't see myself drinking ""The Switch"" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend ""The Swtich"". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang."
6964,6965,B0021HVSBU,Too much mint,"I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka ""herbal infusion"") and in my opinion, mint and ""tropical"" don't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea."
6967,6968,B0009PCPJA,great and easy way to buy,"We go through a lot of dressing and my husband HAS to have this brand only, so I saw this and said GREAT!"
6969,6970,B004K30HO2,Cups work great,"The cups to make my own coffee K-cups work fine.  If there had been free shipping it would have been better, but I will order again and look for a way to not pay 1/2 the price of the product just for shipping."
7167,7168,B000LKYVZE,SOOO GOOD!,"My family has been enjoying Bug Bites organic chocolates for years.  I highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties.  They are very smooth and rich, and not the least bit ""waxy"" tasting like some of the more popular American chocolates.  Each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child. Each tiny package contains a special treat- a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts.  If you have a budding entomologist on your hands, these are the perfect treat! The Endangered Species company is environmentally conscious too, and dedicates 10% of their net profit to support species and habitat preservation."
7170,7171,B0017JBE4E,Dog was pleased,"I put this in my dog's stocking for Christmas.  He was very pleased with the snack.  He likes regular sweet potato fries, so I thought a package of dog ones would make him happy."
7173,7174,B004OQLIHK,My favorite chocolate covered raisins,"Over the years, I have become an expert on chocolate covered raisins. For something so simple, it's surprising how difficult it is to find one that is truly exceptional. In some, the chocolate is too waxy and tasteless. In others, the raisins are too small or dried out. Kirkland chocolate covered raisins are just right. The raisins are large and moist, and the chocolate is high quality. I used to think that brach's made a good one, until I had these.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is a chocolate covered raisin fan, this is one you must try. The tub is huge and the price is less than boutique chocolatiers want for a small bag of theirs. It is an outstanding value and I doubt you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I have no affiliation with Kirkland or anyone else. I'm just a chocolate raisin fan who knows when he has a great raisin...and these are truly wonderful."
7180,7181,B003TDRKHQ,My Dog Loves it!,"This dog food is a keeper. I have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and brown rice.<br />My Vet prescribed an Iams brand food with kangaroo meat in it. My dog didn't really care for the taste but he ate it.<br />I wanted something more natural, so I looked up Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips. What frustrates me, is how you have to wean your dog off of the old food<br />to gradually get used to the new. He liked the flavor so much, he ate around the old dog food and only ate the Flint River Fish & Chips. Fortunately, his tummy handled<br />the new food really well. We have no problem getting him to eat and I like that he doesn't have to eat a larger serving to get the same nutrition. I will definitely order<br />Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips again, and soon. I recommend it highly."
7181,7182,B001EO5YHK,"If you're into spicy, this is the best.","I became a fan for Dave's Gourmet Dave's Burning Nuts about 3 years ago.  This is a very addicting snack. A hefty dose of heat with just the right amount of saltiness. I've introduced them to a number of my co-workers who are now big fans.  I have tried the other spicy nut products on the market, but so far, Dave's is by far the champ!"
7193,7194,B00152OCGU,"10 weeks pregnant, these are my go-to item!","YUMMY.  That should be all my review says.  But really, these are just that, yummy.  I am 10 weeks pregnant and haven't felt like eating much these last few weeks, but tonight, the night before I have to fast for a blood draw, I was craving some banana moon pies.  Off to the store I went and bought a box of these mini moon pies - the perfect size!!  You don't feel as bad eating two of them because they are so small, and eating 4 of them is kinda like eating 2 of the bigger ones, not that I did that or anything.  haha  Go get your banana moon pies today - you won't regret it!!"
7194,7195,B004UNSBMM,Why can't I find this locally?,"This is absolutely the best tasting coffee I have ever drank!  I can't find it locally, thankfully Amazon has saved me once again."

They have more Buffalo favorites, Chivetta's sauce, hot sauce ... check them out!"
7202,7203,B000ES3LMC,Excellent,"A friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday.  I accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew.  I was very happy with the smoothness of this tea.  While it was quite strong, nothing was overpowering and the bitterness I expected was not present at all.<br /><br />My 2nd brewing was done with more care.  This tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor.  I'll be buying Ahmad tea in the future."
7211,7212,B001SAZ6OQ,Very Tasty!,"Nice serving size, good complement to breakfast.  Low in fat, high in protein, and taste great.  I keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them, or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside.  They are pre-cooked.  Love 'em!"
7212,7213,B000F5CDEG,Hartz Rawhide Chew Sticks Pack of 20,MADE IN CHINA..<br />Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.<br />Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....
7213,7214,B004AC0OF0,Good,"My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much."
7215,7216,B002R7XYBQ,impressive gift,"Was surprised of the inexpensive price tag and skeptical when purchased.  As it turns out, it is a charming and unique gift and a great buy for the price!"
7216,7217,B001RIXUS8,"great, tasty mix",REALLY good mix. Pleasantly surprised to find it includes macadamia nuts. We will enjoy this mix immensely. I am sure we will order it again.
7224,7225,B00094HIZC,horribly overpriced,The stuff is great but I'll pay at most $4 or $5 for four bottles.
7233,7234,B000GC0FIE,Best on market!,"If you are a chamomile tea drinker, you will be happy to discover this tea.  The citrus addition makes for a full-bodied but smooth tea.  Definitely the best chamomile tea on the market.  Also, I brew one bag in a coffee maker dedicated to tea only, and get a whole pot out of each bag.  You won't be disappointed in this one."
7235,7236,B001D4Q5AG,Their favorite,"Our little chihuahuas are picky eaters. I really don't find canned foods helpful, since they won't eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight. These are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble. Even better, when we travel, these are easy to open and carry.<br /><br />Of all of the selections, the beef chicken combo is their favorite! They always gobble this one up right away."
7236,7237,B001HTE5HM,Like an indian meal in a stick,"I must be in love if I'm mulling over a 12 pack of big bags for myself. I love the crunch, intense curry flavor, seediness, and the fact they are gluten free. These are one of the more original savory snacks you can find. They're very hard so you need good teeth and I love the substantial curry flavor that is not ""kind of indian"" tasting."
7242,7243,B00310X7T2,Sinfully Rich,"I was extremely impressed with the single serve Pecan Pies. I expected a middle of the road product, thought I'd give them a try.<br />  The ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect. Pie has a rich home baked flavor, and the size is wonderful. 2-Ounces is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet. It's satisfying without being overly sweet.<br />  I will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after Thanksgiving Dinner."
7246,7247,B0056CSBTO,Almost no detectable flavor,"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again."
7248,7249,B00382UXU4,BEST Popcorn we've EVER used!,"We only like WHITE popcorn, and the only grocery store option where we live is Jolly Time, which is not bad.  For fun, we started ordering various white popcorns online, and THIS is BY FAR the VERY BEST white popcorn!!  Wish it were a little less expensive, but we've decided that it really is THAT much better than others.  We are now Snappy white popcorn snobs!  :)"
7277,7278,B001L54464,Disappointing,"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.<br /><br />I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.<br /><br />I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good."
7278,7279,B0064GM4JO,The Best Cheese Spread you'll ever eat!,"If you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish, I would give this a try. It was a instant party favorite when I brought this and crackers to friends house.  I would recommend this to anyone!"
7279,7280,B002ARIEXQ,"Onion-Garlic Dry Roasted Soy Nuts -- OK, but not great!","I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion-Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more ""toasted"" than they were.  The flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after I ate them -- bummer!  I am looking for something else."
7283,7284,B0045TEG7K,Holiday treat,This is a very good gingerbread mix. Lots of flavor and easy to make. It's probably a bit overpriced but I was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store. I use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries. I'll purchase another six boxes when I run out of mix. A good buy and good product.
7284,7285,B0014C3QTU,quick glucose boost with no sticky pockets!,"This packaging is awesome - my main annoyance with regular Jolly Ranchers is that if you keep them in your pocket, they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket. Not delicious. This packaging completely fixes all that - it's the size of a pack of gum, and the candies don't stick to anything!<br /><br />Clearly not the healthiest thing to eat, but if you're on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for 8+hours, these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and wobbly and hypoglycemic.<br /><br />Totally no nutrition in these, but they are GREAT for when you need a bit of glucose boost."
7285,7286,B004I5KO9K,"Took some getting used to, but I love them now.","These crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they aren't like your usual chip or cracker.  Some people I've shared them with don't care for them at all, but some loved them.  I am on a raw food diet, and I use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips.  Raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you're really hungry, these will fill you up fast!  Just make sure you drink a lot of water and don't eat too many at once.  I personally liked all the flavors.  The onion was just a bit strong for some, but I thought it was ok.  Will definitely be buying again."
7291,7292,B0013L55KA,Love mustard but this flavor is too mild for my taste,"I loved the Foods Alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers.  When I finished my entire order of 6 bags, I decided to try the Mustard flavor since I love all mustards on almost everything.  Well...I just finished my first bag of it last night and it's ok - Organic, Crisp & fresh for sure.  But doesn't compare to the strong & powerful garlic & onion flavor.  Maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate.  But I just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you like a mild mustard & always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients & no fillers or chemicals, then this flavor is for you and I would recommend that you try it."
7292,7293,B007I6QB84,Quality Nut Butters,Nuttzo makes great nut butters. Their chocolate version is like Nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. Delicious and super-nutritious.
7293,7294,B004B30K3Y,took forever,I bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. The order said it'd take 5 business days. It ended up taking over 3 weeks
7294,7295,B0000V1B4I,Great Tea but need a filter!,I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.
7303,7304,B001EO5OSO,More like pancake syrup.,I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.
7307,7308,B0029XO8OA,Flavorful and Natural Garrotxa Goat Cheese,"I love cheese in general. I've had lots of European cheeses, and this one is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />The texture is a bit hard, not creamy as French cheeses; and the flavor is full and rich. Great to serve with some bread and of course, some wine. It is great with salads as well, you won't need any dressing since the cheese is enough a good flavor enhancer by itself.<br /><br />I have shared it with many guests and they ALL love it. It's not salty like Cheddar and smoked cheeses, it's more of a refined goat-milky flavor.<br /><br />It's always a Success!"
7309,7310,B00438HHVA,"Festival doesn't tell us what they mean by ""Fresh Pack""","Your guess is as good as mine regarding what Festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are ""Fresh Pack.""  On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the ""bad"" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil."
7310,7311,B000LKVPM6,Really good gravy!,I tried this at first as a gluten-free alternative to cream of mushroom soup.  Turns out its really good!  Modified my MILs swedish meatballs recipe using this sauce as the base.  Also served it with shitakes over rice.  Very versatile and tasty! And its great that the ingredients don't read like an industrial compound.
7311,7312,B0049W9AWE,Have a spot of tea !,"I seem to have entered my green tea ""wave"".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner."
7312,7313,B000GJF5AA,Seasoned well,"I made the 10 bean soup with a few modifications.  I added carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes.  However, I did not have to adjust the seasoning.  This is not a bland soup.  Excellent!  I also gave Women's Bean soups, dips, and salsas to my extended family for Christmas.  Everyone loved the gift- it simplified my shopping, and I felt like I was helping those who really need the help."
7317,7318,B003OP8L22,Decent tasting,"This coffee tastes pretty good, and I like the fact that it's organic (coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides).  However, each time I use Subscribe & Save, unfortunately, the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later, which is why I had to cancel my subscription to this."
7318,7319,B005P0YJ34,Love me some stevia!,Hooray for an all natural sweetner! Say goodbye to sugar and chemical based sweetners and get your hands on this stevia!
7320,7321,B001H05FMA,A beautiful vinegar,"I bought this vinegar along with 2 others for my father for Christmas. I wish they could have all been shipped together, but they went separately. Good vinegar though."
7321,7322,B0042395CA,"Decent, but not great","When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."
7322,7323,B004YVQ7Q2,Nice,"MY wife had some white balsamic from a store in Boston and loved it. So, I figured I'd get her some for Xmas; but I couldn't get to Boston! This product and seller gave me a good alternative. It is a fantastic product and she loves it. We use it with lemon or other infused olive oils on salad or what have you. NICE!"
7323,7324,B004DOYN70,Pumpkin Spice Ground,"Very disappointed, not much pumpkin or spice, just pretty close to plain old coffee.  I was hoping for something like they have at Tim Horton's but its not even close."
7324,7325,B0019DCU50,Purchased chamomile,Excellent product. Exactly what they said it would be. Superior chamomile from what I have ordered before from other companies. Excellent value for the price.
7325,7326,B00351JX8G,Delicioso !!,"I am not a coffee purist...but I am addicted.  I've dabbled in the flavorings & coffee-wannabe's, and this is by far my favorite.  I usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of Vanilla Caramel Latte, just so I have an extra afternoon shot of energy.  Extra bonus - when you pour the hot water over the mixture, it hisses & purrs :)"
7330,7331,B003DIIZ9O,My dog loves 'em,"We have a little shih tzu who absolutely loves Cesar Softies dog treats.  We have tried different flavors, but she seems to enjoy the Grilled Chicken Flavor the most.  They are soft enough to break in half, and that is more than enough to satisfy a little dog's yearning for a reward."
7338,7339,B000FAM3Z0,Natures Logic Venisen,This is The best dog food their is because everything is very. Digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it. So it is healther and the best out their far as I'm think
7340,7341,B000I6O6RO,Coffee Masters Coffee,This brand of coffee is excellent; you can really taste the flavors unlike many store bought flavored coffees I have tried. I like the individual packets as they stay fresh longer and I just use what I need out of the packet so it lasts a long time. I would highly recommend this coffee; it's worth the price!!!
7345,7346,B0049ZCFUA,Best marinade for Fried Turkey Ever,"This is the best marinade to inject in a Fried Turkey EVER made!  You don't have to add anything of your own (maybe a little olive oil, but that's all).  Plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey, BUT this marinade can be injected to make a tender, juicy fried turkey.  We LOVED it!"
7346,7347,B000EDG4TE,Delicious! Try these before buying other brands,"If you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted, seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value...or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam. Fortunately, neither description applies to these. They are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating. No added salt or other nuisance chemicals - just delicious and nutritious snack. Mix with raisins and/or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc/other vital nutrition or use with breads, cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe."
7371,7372,B000MJKZ0O,This Ice Cream Club ROCKS!!!,"Recently, I was gifted the Ice Cream of the Month Club by a very good friend. I was somewhat confused thinking ""how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club?"" But, with having given and received numerous ""of the month clubs"" and having all great experiences in the past, I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the ""Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato."" After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having ""velvet wrapping around your body."" The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!"
7373,7374,B001EPQQL2,Great low calorie sweetner!,"I use this in all my recipes calling for brown sugar.  As per the INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, use ONE-HALF the amount called for in the recipe. If the recipe states ONE CUP of brown sugar, you use ONLY ONE-HALF cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I am not a diabetic but I do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for ""real"" brown sugar, even though it does contain part Splenda and part ""real"" brown sugar."
7395,7396,B004LGBJKE,Potato Sticks,"Who ever is making French's Potato Sticks,Keep it up! They are the best! French's should have keep them in their line.Mike"
7396,7397,B003XJBC48,"DARE You to Eat just ""1"" Bag!","Oh My - these are going on my list to re-order! They are absoultely DELCIOUS! Actually like them a lot better than the Oreos with cream in the middle. Crispy, crunchy, low cal cookie (if you can eat only 1 bag, that is). Packs a powerful chocolate punch - for a low cal snack. Satisfies my chocolate craving without the guilt. [Actually choose these over the Lorna Doone thins any day - more flavorful & satisfying]. Have to stop myself from ripping open a 2nd pkg."
7397,7398,B001NDHL5K,yum,"My 10 month old son has been a fan of Yummy Spoonfuls from his first bite. The Garden Medley flavor is a new favorite. The puree is thick and almost creamy, perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture. He's always happy when I bring a cup of this to his tray!"
7398,7399,B0002Q1X6C,"beware, these are tuber indicum, not melanosporum","These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.<br /><br />I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles""."
7420,7421,B005LMLXN0,No bitterness great flavor and it does work,"Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product."
7431,7432,B0001E1IME,amazon monopoly/ripoff,love the snack.  wanted to buy a bunch.<p>shipping at amazon is more than the price of the snack.  try ordering a dozen and then look at the shipping price.<p>every link i've tried to this snack takes you back to amazon's exhorbitant shipping rates.<p>another reason to buy your books at overstock.com.  too back they don't carry food as well.
7432,7433,B002GWMCIS,Chocolate Raspberry Flavored Coffee,"This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate/Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.  I too am sorry I couldn't buy just 1 lb. to try it first -- Now I am stuck with this awful coffee I cannot return.  SO, BUYER BEWARE -- NO RETURNS!"
7438,7439,B006OKIIMM,dog treat,Nice small nutritious biscuit. Nice pocket size. Resealable pouch is a plus as well. Will order more in the future.
7440,7441,B005HVDZRM,mmmm good tea,I am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. This tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. I usually use the K-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. The price is the best i have found anywhere
7446,7447,B0079LUEOA,Fantastic!!,"Please don't tell me this is going to be a ""seasonal"" find only!!!  I made the pink lemonade cake with the pink lemonade frosting for July 4th and it was such a big hit!!!  The blend of lemon, sweet, and pink are just right!!!  When I went back to get more mixes they had been relegated to the ""Seasonal Clearance"" section -- and I could only find 2 cake mixes and no more frosting.  = (  It's definitely a year round keeper -- I'm thinking granddaughter birthday parties, ballet recital parties, pinkalicious parties!!!"
7449,7450,B007NVJ4CY,My Fav!,"This is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new Vue. I don't like strong-tasting coffee - I prefer Dunkin Donuts over Starbucks. Until they come out with a Dunkin Donuts vue pack, this light roast is perfect for me."
7452,7453,B001D6KP14,very good,"I was very happy with the way this turned out. It is very similar to traditional American beers(Bud/Coors) but with an extra kick. The flavor is very smooth, has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes. This is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike. If you are to anxious to wait for it to age, you can drink it after 2 weeks. It will taste good, but get better with age. Make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates. Lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions."
7459,7460,B00769ZSVO,Greatest healthy snack,"These almond rice pops are a very healthy snack.  17 cubes are 2 points in weight watchers and you feel like you are cheating. They are oven baked, all natural and extremely tasty.  Biggest problem is they are very hard to find. Almond Pops with Blueberry used to be sold at Costco but no longer. Can't find those anywhere<br />I order often and in volume because my friends all like them too so I share my orders with them<br />Expensive snack but well worth it"
7468,7469,B001IZK9OI,NASTY-Shouldn't even be sold!-no stars,"Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And what's up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so I'm throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you!<br />(Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)"
7469,7470,B000143ZK2,A Better Choice for the Movies or Anytime!,"Looking for a more nutritious snack? Ever wish that your favorite buttery popcorn was just a little better for you? The answer is here. Grandpa Po's Orginals, innovative snack made from organic soybeans,comes in Slightly Unsalted and Slightly Spicy.<br /><br /> Our family & friends love this terrifc snack. What a bonus that it is also organic and good for us! I can eat the whole bag all by myself & have! Our 4 kids & their friends love them too. We have been requested to only bring Grandpa Po's Nutra Nuts for our snack turn at Girl Scouts, Confrimation, and for the tennis team. We have been so lucky to have been able to enjoy them for years! Thank you! Betsy from NJ"
7491,7492,B00170WH12,Great stuff! Too expensive on Amazon,I bought some of this. Creates an awesome effect on decorated cakes and candies. Love it! Completely edible.<br /><br />But WAYYY overpriced on Amazon. Usually Amazon is cheaper than buying in stores but these are only $4 at any craft store so $15 is SEVERELY overpriced.
7495,7496,B000LQNCRG,great product great service,"we enljoy having Loumidis greek coffee every day.Iam an expert making the coffee. When my mother in law was alive she wanted to have greek coffee every day at four in the afternoon, so kept the trantition"
7496,7497,B0000T15GY,Taste lacks,"Not as tasty as some of the others out there, but for the bulk, I'd pay again."
7498,7499,B00126EQ88,The real deal (ALMOST),"I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.<br /><br />If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind, this is it.<br /><br />I'll admit I do salt the bacon just a tad before I fry it.<br /><br />This is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon."
7500,7501,B000S11CD0,Bueno!,Cant make corn tortillas or tamales without masa harina. These folks ship their product in sturdy boxes. Great for making a long journey overseas.
7503,7504,B000DINB5U,grape leaves,these make a good and very filling lunch with a little bit of lemon juice squeezed over them.
7504,7505,B0001M0Z3O,What an hot offer,"With cayenne pepper, it is about the quantity you get for a price and I believe I got a very very good bargain.  Doesn't happen often, but it is so nice when it does.<br /><br />Thanks"
7517,7518,B00474J808,dissapointed in order,I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now don't even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but it's not available.<br /><br />Very Disappointed<br /><br />Leona<br /><br />The order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.<br /><br />Transaction Date  11/03/2011<br />Location<br />Amount  $20.94<br />Reference Number  [...]<br />Description  Amazon.com AMZN.COM/BILLWA
7518,7519,B000OIWY8Y,ADDICTIVELY FANTASTIC!!,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles, grace in VT"
7528,7529,B001YJ8ITG,A Flavorful Crunch,"The best soda crackers so tempting I've reordered.<br /><br />I will probably not order a third time though because of the high shipping cost... nothing to do with my satisfaction with the product.<br />I hope the company will consider using Amazon Prime.<br />I savor each crunch, delicious.<br />Thanks..."
7529,7530,B00061KXUA,Ex-pat Australian favorite!,"Although Dundee's orange marmalade is stocked everywhere, their hard-to-find ginger preserve is truly incredible. I have tried many other brands but this one is truly classic with the intense ginger flavor I love. Try it on a warm English muffin, crunchy fresh waffles or as a roast chicken glaze."
7538,7539,B005IK4DY6,Pricing is out of line - 2X the price of buying them from Nespresso,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.<br /><br />Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better."
7540,7541,B00734W80Q,"Great aroma, no after-burn","I picked this off the shelf without any research, and my husband, who's pretty particular about his vodka (and tequila, and rum, but that's another story) loved this. I'm not a vodka drinker, but even I had to admit the first smell and taste were extremely pleasant and he said it tasted wonderful straight and excellent in mixed drink. Made by two guys from Pennsylvania using a copper still --definitely worth the price."
7541,7542,B0018RXITE,ONLY SUNFLOWER BUTTER WE WILL BUY,"oUR 3 YEAR OLD SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BEING ALLERGIC TO SOY AND PEANUTS. THIS IS THE ONLY SUNFLOWER BUTTER THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT IS FREE OF BOTH ALLERGENS AND NOT PROCESSED ON SHARED EQUIPMENT.  THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT WE BUY NOW.  OUR SON LIKES IT ON PB&J, CRACKERS, ON CELERY AND BY THE SPOONFUL AND WITH NO SUGARS ADDED MUCH MORE HEALTHY FOR HIM."
7556,7557,B001I7JDK2,Easy Now tea is great!,"I put 1-2 teabags of Easy Now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20-30 min and have some before bed. No matter when I got to sleep, I always wake up 7-8 hours later, feeling good, and without having woken up in the middle of the night. (except maybe to use the restroom, but I always fall back asleep instantly) Its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves, it won't make you sleepy. This is easily my favorite calming tea."
7557,7558,B0029J9U8S,perfect size,"These are perfect for portion control.  I like the stand up bag too, great for putting the candy in the fridge as opposed to the flat bags.  My husband and I are both trying to lost weight, and to be able to grab one of these 70-90 calorie chocolate packs from M&M are great.<br />I was also very pleased with how they were shipped.  You have to pay a little for 2 freezie packs, but that's fine and then it came in a styrofoam box to keep the chocolate from melting.<br />I'll definitely order these from amazon again."
7560,7561,B002UQ7NP2,Great Fruity Taste,"I really like the fruity taste of this tea - so much so that I can actually drink it without sugar.  If you like fruity teas, you should try this product."
7565,7566,B0014J9OTE,AWESOME!!!,My husband and I absolutely love this gum that is actually good for you!!! It keeps flavor for a long time!!!!
7570,7571,B000RI8CFA,Greenies,Wow!  Great price! I'll never buy these at the pet store again!  About 6 months ago we started giving our rat terriers Greenies after my vet told me about them.  We couldn't afford $400 +  each to have our dog's teeth cleaned (and there is just no way these dogs would let me brush their teeth) so we tried these.  What a difference it made!!!!  The tartar an plaque buildup on my 11 yr old girl is almost completely gone and my 6 yr old boy's teeth look like I had them professionally cleaned.  The added bonus is Greenies make their breath smell great and my dogs love the taste of them!
7573,7574,B000ELWDR8,"good soup, too many dents","The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit."
7581,7582,B000CQ6KSI,Highly addictive,"This is, quite simply, the best Mac 'n Cheese on the market. It is our go-to meal for when we haven't gone to the grocery store and desperately need a dinner.<br /><br />My tips:<br />+ Add the ""optional"" butter, you know you want to.<br />+ Personally I find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to bring out its flavors<br />+ Some fresh ground pepper rounds it out<br /><br />If you like this stuff, I also highly recommend the Annie's snack mix (I think also available on Amazon). I believe Annie's makes both products with their patented Bunny Cocaine(tm). The dangerous addiction I've developed is totally worth it."
7596,7597,B000FJZB64,Good quality - not 'getting' whatever flavor difference...,"I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work."
7597,7598,B0009EIOPK,Best (and easiest) Bread Ever!,"This has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix I've come across.  Incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail.  Plus the loafs come out perfect everytime (I've had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours).  I've purchased this ""collection"" several times and will continue to do so."
7602,7603,B0028GY93S,HAPPY Healthy Dog's,"I first purchased this food at the Pomona Pet Expo this year and as I do all my cooking for my animals I was looking for a natural grain free dry to add to their wet.  I learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible.<br /><br />This by far is one of the best Natural foods I have purchased and my dogs just (Love) it..  The Holistic Primitive is high in Protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs.  This food has never been recalled and is made in it's own plant, unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names.  The price I find to be fare, as I have paid much higher for other Holistic food which was not received well by my dogs.<br /><br />I highly recommend Earthborn Natural food for anyone who really knows the importance of feeding your ""companions"" healthy food and for those who really Love their Pet's.."
7612,7613,B004A72PKM,Yummy!,"I have to disagree with another reviewer; I did not find this PB gritty at all.  I always but natural PB without any added sugar and also did not find this too sweet.  It has a nice, not overpowering, taste of maple.  Great snack on rice cakes!"
7614,7615,B005J6MG66,THE DRINK OF CHOICE FROM HELL,"This superb tasting drink was used at the turn of the century for medicinal purposes as it purportedly had calming , but hallucinogenic effects. Thought to have same effects as THC but was disproved in 1999. But still , it is a very popular drink if mixed properly . Which is dissolving sugar through an absinthe spoon and mixing with vodka . Aptly named TNT. The drink was somewhat popularized by the character Inspector Frederick Abberline, played by Johnny Depp in the movie FROM HELL based upon Jack The Ripper."
7615,7616,B008DGFTU4,So refreshing and tasty,My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.
7616,7617,B000TRFGGM,Could not be happier!,I ordered this and several other plants from this seller.<br /><br />I was quite suprised to find that the plant was much larger than I expected (with a full six heads on it!) and well packed. Every plant I got in this shipment is thriving and happy. It has been two weeks now and nothing has failed to thrive. This is more than I can say about others that I have bought from!<br /><br />I will be buying from this company again.
7661,7662,B001TZU18Q,Best White Polenta,I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen.
7662,7663,B00345ZVH0,Peanut Butter Mixed With Clouds,"Whipped peanut butter isn't for everyone; it's basically just peanut butter whipped up so it has more air in it.  For some reason, however, I LOVE it.  It spreads easier and seems to taste sweeter, lighter, and fluffier.  If you're a peanut butter freak, definitely give this stuff a try."
7664,7665,B007Z8IHC8,Disappointing Filled Bones!,"My golden retriever loves these bones!  I ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner.  However, when I opened the box, they were old - meaning the filling was somewhat dried and didn't completely fill the hoof due to shrinkage.  Once the plastic is removed, the filling pretty much falls out.  Very disappointing!"
7665,7666,B004ASGJ5S,Love it--and allergen free,"This is one of the few canned sauces without citric acid. Their canned ground tomatoes I use all the time for sauce, better than imported San Marzano, and I am an Italian-American.  I know my sauce.  This can be found in some local supermarkets, here in NY it is in ShopRite, BestYet, and in larger cans at Sam's Club for under $4 for a HUGE 6 lb. can! In supermarkets, I bought it recently at $1 for a 15 oz. can on sale, regularly priced under $2 for a 15 oz. can.  Look for it and try it. Nice and thick and tasty as it should be.  An additional bonus for me personally is that it contains no food allergens such as dairy, eggs, or nuts.  Safe for my granddaughter who is allergic."
7670,7671,B003I5XMLI,Highly recommended cat food,"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route."
7671,7672,B001E5DZTS,Bang!,I was looking all over for milk in a paint can and I found it! Thank you Amazon. The only down side is that it is the sweet milk from a goat's teat. Once one gets over that it is by far the best powdered milk in a paint can that I ever ordered online.
7764,7765,B000E1BLS0,Yummy Cheesecake Dessert,"This is great for a quick, easy, versatile dessert when you don't want to heat up the oven. Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake-like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini-cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store."
7770,7771,B00579RB42,It's alright.,"I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me."
7772,7773,B007J6KEPY,Like little glistening rubies...,"After recently having a chance to try out all the flavors of these brand new David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, I have to say the Pomegranate is by far my favorite. The flavor is just perfect. Sweet, but not too sweet. Not tart or overpowering in flavor. It's mild and the taste is just right. The beans appearance is even beautiful! With their rich red color and shine, they look like little glistening rubies that catch the light. You can even taste the difference in how these are made using natural ingredients and coloring. They actually have a fresh taste to them. Not hard, artificial and stale tasting like so many other brands. These are a truly gourmet jelly beans."
7774,7775,B000G7VYWU,"Great ""On the Go"" snack!",Great on the go snack to take in the car for my 3 and 5 year old! NO MESSY HANDS like other snacks. Keeps the car much cleaner! :) Also great for me as a Weight Watcher snack with a wedge of Laughing Cow Lite Cheese! YUM!!!
7784,7785,B000E1BM16,A longtime favorite coffee in our home!,First thing in the morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news.  We have always drunk Maxwell house coffee and even when I was a child my parents used it.  It is one of the best coffee brands available.  As we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the Maxwell House Decaf blend.  It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.<br /><br />The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder.  On sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping.  This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.
7788,7789,B004DOTIQ6,hey they're oreos...,what can i say... great cookies. the only way to improve it is if it came with some cold milk.
7790,7791,B0050HZ3V4,Not exactly what I thought I was getting.,"Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix is very, very good.  However, know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix.  You are getting individual (or for two people) servings of pancake and waffle mix.  This formula is different than that for the larger packages of Baking and Pancake Mix and does not make biscuits, muffins, or other short breads very well, too sweet for my taste.  If you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles, then get the larger packages."
7791,7792,B0029XIU9E,My New Favorite Cheese,"I've tried many different cheeses, and I have to say Gorgonzola is my most favorite.<br /><br />The texture, aroma and flavor is both bold and pleasant yet not overbearing.<br /><br />A highly recommended cheese for novice cheese enthusiasts."
7792,7793,B005EKHZY0,mary lou,I love this mix. i use it  in several different recipes. Its moist and has a good consistency. The only problem is that  its difficult to find and I end up buying it on line!  Any suggestions???
7793,7794,B003P7ZN70,GREAT PRODUCT IN PERFECT SIZE CAN!,I have been drinking V-8 juice for many years. Ordering it from Amazon by the case with free shipping(Prime) allows me to have it on hand in a convenient can with the right amount for my needs.
7800,7801,B00474H936,Great Substitute!,"I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have a meat eating husband.  For years, I have been looking for a good ground beef substitute.  I finally found one.  This one had a good taste and texture when cooked.  My meat eating husband is even happy with it when I use it.  One of the things I love is that I use this to make meatballs, and they stay together.  In the past, they never stayed together.  This is a great product, and I'm happy I found it."
7814,7815,B000HB9TLI,heart healthy tea,"good tea -- good for blood pressure. tastes good and smells good too.webvitamins good place to order from. fast and efficient, especially with amazon as the go-between."
7824,7825,B001A47SLE,super tasty,"I love to make sun tea with these tea bags, it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass. It is tasty and not too sweet, highly recommended!"
7834,7835,B0035E92TI,Great boost!,"I love this stuff!  I sit in front of a computer all day at work, it's easy to get tired, not to mention I've always had trouble sleeping, so I never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep, more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night.  I was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but I certainly didn't feel the shakes or jittery at all.  I felt more awake, and I didn't crash from it later.  It wears off gradually after a few hours but it helps to get through the main part of the day.  I don't use it every day but on occassion when I need a boost."
7837,7838,B005ZS7L7M,POOR DESCRIPTION,"I didn't order because it doesn't indicate anywhere what size the bottle is, I think that's basic information, maybe you should include that in your description"
7838,7839,B000NY6PAC,Curry Ket.,I ushally get this curry cat. at the store but they stopped carring it.  It helps me remember the tast of some foods from Germany.  I will shop here again when I need some more.
7839,7840,B00067ITNW,Fantastic,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
7842,7843,B000ELWDRI,NOT What I Ordered,"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased."
7860,7861,B000JIJFOU,wrapped securely and fresh!,Very good WHITE CHOCOLATE and Very Fresh too! Ty! Thank you for wrapping securely. Quick shipment was appreciated very much!
7863,7864,B001GSOIY4,Kinetic Kraziness!,"This coffee (er, koffee) is superb!  I am lucky enough to live where this is roasted.  I can get my Kinetic fix at the local grocery stores.  You can taste the care put into this flavorful espresso.  Living in a small town, I happen to know the roasters.  You would be hard pressed to find better people.  They are active participants of the ""Great Arcata to Ferndale World Championship Cross-Country Kinetic Sculpture"" race.  If you haven't heard of it, look it up.  We are a strange people, here in Arcata."
7864,7865,B004B9EQKQ,Premium Dog Food,"First quality, dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient, therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections."
7866,7867,B000LKUU7W,Top 10 Super Food,"Wow, organic lentils, how great is that! Lentils are one of the planet's top 10 super foods, extremely high in protein and fiber, extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale. This is one food I try to eat everyday. I live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of California, and you'd think our ""high-end"" supermarket, Raley's, would carry organic lentils, but of course, they don't, and even if they did, I'd have to pay an arm and leg for them. Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally, I don't make the typical lentil soup with these. I simply cook one bag (16 oz.) with about 7.5 cups of non-fluoridated bottled water (fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid), salt them to taste, and only cook them for 25 minutes. This way, they don't get mushy. They keep their firmness without being too chewy, more like a bean, and then I keep them in the fridge for a week, and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top. YUMMY!"
7868,7869,B004N5KTOK,Hershey's kisses,That all that need to be said. The best chocolate candy with the best service. And add a great price and it just can not be beat. The item arrived on time and in good shape like most items ordered through amazon.
7869,7870,B000G17Y9I,YUMMY!,"What I like about these is that they are gluten free, full of flavor and have a hearty corn flavor. They are a bit thicker than some of the chips I've tried out there and hold the salsa!  Love these!"
7875,7876,B0039OGMWE,Favorite cheese made in the USA,"This is a mild, buttery scented cheese. My favorite cheese made in the United States."
7876,7877,B00355HJ0Q,Convenient and good,I bought these for my grandson who is 7 months old. He loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings. His mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along. I like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house. It makes me feel like I have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated.
7878,7879,B004AMLWO2,"My Husband is Italian, but I cheat on him with Greek Olive Oil","I am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years.  I have to say, hands down, this is my favorite olive oil.  It's affordable and non-pretentious.  Amazing flavor.  I use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to drag a piece of crusty bread through or to drizzle over caprese.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking and unsure of what to buy.. because who knows?  But this one is a keeper and a must try!"
7880,7881,B001AMISCE,Waste of money,I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasn't right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high.
7881,7882,B000VZJJIS,Quality Olive Oil at it's best,"A brother in a Sicilian family who owns an Italian Food Market & Deli here in San Diego, tipped me off to this product over a year ago.  The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The product is not widely known but the laboratories at Academia Barilla in Italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion, it is the very best.  The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.  Use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience.  Quality makes a difference."
7882,7883,B004H37C98,Best Rawhides Available Anywhere!,"Sure, this rawhide is expensive at 5-6 dollars per rawhide.  However, it is excellent quality (many rolls very tightly rolled) and takes my GSD hours to go through one.  For reference, he can eat a thick bully stick in 5 minutes and a Himalayan Dog Chew in 30 minutes.  For the time spent chewing per dollar, these rawhides are a deal!  I also love that my dogs can't get big chunks off, so even though I keep an eye on them I have very little fear of choking."
7883,7884,B000JMFCO8,great for one year olds,I mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son's bottle and it keeps him full longer. My mother says she used it on me when I was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full. My son seems to really enjoy it.
7888,7889,B003V0Q1VI,Great deal,"I switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these McCormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing. My attraction was the price. This deal is better than any I have found in local grocery stores... even with shipping/handling. Well worth the price. Shipment was fast, no breaking or damage. This is one of those 'more bang for your buck' deals.... worth it!"
7889,7890,B001LMPE2U,"""Elegant & English"" Honey & Almond All-Butter Biscuits","These English tea biscuits are baked by hand in Ashbourne, Derbyshire by Artisan Biscuits. The cookies are essentially flavored shortbread with a very distinct taste of butter, honey, and almonds and an excellent texture at once crumbly and crispy with a nice buttery mouthfeel.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to run across them at Jack's $0.99 Store (2 packages for $0.99!) in three flavors:  Honey & Almond, Ginger & Lemon, and Rosehip & Blackcurrant.  They were quite the hit and immediately became the subject of conversation.<br /><br />The Honey & Almond was universally loved.  A few people thought that the ginger was a bit too strong or else didn't like the floral taste of the rosehips but those were just personal preferences of people generally not fond of those flavors.  In each instance, I thought the flavor combinations  were both well chosen and perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Overall, you couldn't ask for better quality in a packaged cookie.  I only regret that the Chocolate & Raspberry, Coconut & Lime, and Vanilla & Cream varieties weren't available to try as well.  Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Wheat flour<br />Butter 25.7%<br />Sugar<br />Honey 6.2%<br />Nibbed almonds 1.1%<br />Natural almond flavoring<br />Emulsifier (Soya lecithin)<br />Raising agent (Sodium bicarbonate)<br /><br />Each 150g/5.3 oz package contains 18 cookies or 6 servings of 3 cookies<br /><br />Nutrition per serving of 3 cookies:<br /><br />Calories 130<br />Calories from fat 50<br />Total fat 6g<br />Saturated fat 4g<br />Trans fat 0.2g<br />Cholesterol 15mg<br />Sodium 45mg<br />Total carbohydrates 18g<br />Dietary fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars 6g<br />Protein 1g"
7890,7891,B004Q7O92I,My greyhounds love it!,"My Greyhounds 7 and 8 years old( both Brood Matrons) loved this lip smacking food. It has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful. In fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg. Changing to Annamaet grainless Salcha,which is small kibbles, from the old food does take a gradual process for the older dogs not because of its size, but because of its high quality. Lastly the company has never had a recall on its products, something we all look for today."
7891,7892,B001L02AX8,Fresh as it gets!,We lived in Charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood - especially oysters!  Now we live about 24 hours away and I do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when I'm in the mood.  I had no idea that I could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days!  It was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat.  Impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish.  SO much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store!  These were HUGE.
7892,7893,B000OP16W2,Very nice.,"Perfect starter tree. It is adorable and the included manual tells you the basics of bonsai. I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day, a live tree instead of cut flowers makes a great gift."
7896,7897,B000E8PXTG,Tasty,"As far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best I've had. Actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies, mostly mushrooms and onions that I could make out. Descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix. They don't show it on the picture here but I'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup. It looks exactly like the one I just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic. If you like spicy noodles definitely don't pass this up.<br /><br />Very good"
7899,7900,B00126EQ8I,The real deal (ALMOST),"I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.<br /><br />If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind, this is it.<br /><br />I'll admit I do salt the bacon just a tad before I fry it.<br /><br />This is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon."
7901,7902,B00285FFCS,I love this Ghirardelli Mint Dark Chocolate. Perfect for after dinner or as a dessert,"This Ghirardelli Mint Dark Chocolate tastes really good. The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as a dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).<br /><br />Sidarta Tanu"
7905,7906,B00166D8TW,Best non-whey non-soy alternative,"Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!"
7931,7932,B000143ZKM,Check out Grandpa Po's Products,"Fantastic product. Keeps fresh for months. Had a bag in my desk that I had opened but packet was resealed, product still fresh after several weeks. Product has a spicy but not hot flavor and is enjoyed by my whole family. I am diabetic and have a hard time finding low sodium, low calorie snacks. Grandpa Po's products are both low sodium, low calorie and also taste great. I would highly recommend."
7933,7934,B000RHXIGO,Everything I expected,"For years I have grown my own habaneros to dry, crush and use for cooking.  I have been unable to do so for the last two years because of a job relocation.  My supply from previous years had run out so I purchased this product to re-supply.<br /><br />I have been tremendously satisfied.  Great quality, great consistency, great heat, good color, good particulate size, good price.<br /><br />Without any reservation would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a good habanero powder.<br /><br />Be warned though... It is not for the faint of heart."
7944,7945,B004Q6J4GU,Terrific Decaf Tea,"My Mom was born in Manchester, England,and I have been drinking tea since I was very young. A few years ago I was forced to switch to decaf tea. Most of the blends available are terrible. I used to drink regular Yorkshire tea, and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong, full-bodied tea, and I love it! I decided to purchase from Amazon because I knew I could count on them, as  well  as their outside vendors. I was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again."
7946,7947,B00032B7AM,Nescafe Mountain blend coffee availability,"I have used this product for over twenty years.  However, it is<br /><br />no longer available in any of the local food markets in the<br /><br />Los Angeles, CA area.  I'm happy that I can order it via<br /><br />Amazon.com"
7947,7948,B002MADM56,Delicious addictive treat,I ordered this candy for a friend as a mother's day gift.  She was delighted to receive it and I was excited to share it. :-)
7948,7949,B002GFMHOE,Pleasantly surprised!,"I was swayed to try this thanks to Amazon's new add-on program. Cod roe pasta is surprisingly good, especially with the toasted nori! I used 100 grams of angel hair pasta with one packet of the sauce. Next time, I may reduce the amount of pasta, or use two packets of sauce, to up the flavor. A dash of red pepper might be good, too."
7951,7952,B002S2XR3U,Great Tree,This is not as tall as they advertised. But we kept it and we like it alot. It is the shining star of our indoor Bonsai collection. Just stunning. Like having a forest in your kitchen! We've had it about 6 months now and it's thriving.
7952,7953,B004YTZXSM,Premium made in the USA treats for dogs & cats!,"One of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that's made in the USA (Connecticut) and isn't made in China.  Time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from CHINA.  Do NOT buy treats made in China for your pets!  Sure, these are a tad more expensive, but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet!  I call it kitty and dog candy!  They come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open.  They LOVE Bravo's real meat treats!"
7954,7955,B004ECNU7K,"Small, but good.  Poor packaging.","Packaging on these leaves something to be desired - last shipment I received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when I opened the first one and removed the bag, there were a lot of broken biscotti.  I expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged.  Given that these are fairly fragile, they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers.<br /><br />The biscotti themselves are tasty, if a bit small.  I wish they were full-sized, 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half.  But as I live in a rural area where people think ""biscotti"" is a kind of biscuit, these are a good second choice."
7956,7957,B001B44XZW,dogs love it,They have other flavors but the dogs favorite is still the original. I wish they carried it in the local petstore we go to purchase their other flavors!
7957,7958,B007TB1SB8,A great discovery!,"We love this sauce and are hunting around to find it and to introduce it to others. Sort of a wasabi mayonnaise--and terrific on fish, potatoes, and many other things (we're eager to discover more)."
7958,7959,B0007WLM8K,Great pastry buy !!!!!,"Was quite pleased with the product. Arrived on time and wrapped well. Would buy again and again !!!!!  Try it, you'll let it !!!!!"
7960,7961,B004WM0ZTS,Convenient and Tasty,"I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.<br /><br />Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.<br /><br />It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.<br /><br />[...]"

8000,8001,B004TGWCBQ,Great Sauce,"This is a great marinade for any kind of meat. I use it also in stir-fry or fried rice receipes.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TGWCBQ"">Garlic Sesame Marinade & Glaze Sauce</a>"
8001,8002,B004G8X0X6,when can I get beaufort in the U.S!,"I had this cheese during the summer on a hiking trip through the French Alps.  We were able to go to a small producer and watch its preparation.  It is really delicious, better than Gruyere, to which it is often compared. When oh when can I get it in the U.S?"
8002,8003,B004Q4C6P8,Wonderful coffee!,"WE LOVE JAMAICAN ME CRAZY coffee!!! It's smooth and rich with a hint of vanilla and caramel.  This is whole bean, so you do have to have a coffee grinder, but totally worth it!"
8003,8004,B006O8AGOM,You get what you pay for,"Caribbean Joy coconut milk offers a tempting price, lower than its competitors.  There's a good reason for its low price: by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk, the rest being water.<br />Neither good for pina coladas or cooking, this is a poor value and I can't recommend it to anyone."
8004,8005,B007WFQ4EM,Koma works and tastes great!!!,"this stuff really works, i love it and cant get enough.  It tastes amazing  Highly recommend trying it, you wont be disappointed!!"
8014,8015,B004SISLQ0,"""This Tea should get the Nobel Peace Prize""","This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
8027,8028,B0012KH06Y,"Since I got the marinated morsals, that is all my cat will eat","I have used Fancy Feast for years. When I saw the Marinated Morsals come out, I tried them and no I ONLY get the Marinated Morsels, by request of ""Smoky (my black cat).<br /><br />He loves them and more than the other line.<br /><br /> If you cat is like Smoky, where he much prefers cat food with gravy on it, so that he licks through it and gets his meat with it as well. Plus, if you cat likes the smaller morals of food, like my cat does, then your cat should really like the Marinated Morsals.<br /><br />There have been times I have tried to switch to difference brands, but if the pieces of meat or fish are large for him, he will only lap up the gravy. The Marinated Morsals are his favorite.<br /><br />I keep waiting for my Smok to start talking to me, so I can understand his food choices as well as his philosophy on life :-), but until then, Smokey and the others cats that I have had, have seemed to communicate to me pretty darn well as what they want and have all trained me very well.<br /><br />Jon"
8029,8030,B000ZZVKDQ,wine country gal,"My dughter used these, and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes!  Said it was like she had just picked them fron a garden!"
8030,8031,B004KAHKEU,Must mix it with fruit or other tasty baby food,"I love the fact that this is multi-grain baby food.... but like people food, good for you things NEVER taste great... so mix it with bananas or some other fruit. Yes, the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones, hence why you want to thin it out. I read the other reviews and can't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else."
8035,8036,B001E6K67Q,GOOD,"It's more of a side dish than a main dish. Cook in some chili beans and peppers then it's more of a meal. It also made a very good taco salad. It was also good as burrito filling with some extra cheese. This is a good starting point to let your imagination make good great. The expiration date on mine was good for a year, well into 2008."
8039,8040,B001HTG8EU,Best chestnuts ever,"Have roasted and peeled chestnuts all my life. Since I have less time and energy now, I ordered these in a jar already peeled. Tried lots of different ones and found these to be the most tasteful and clean and fresh."
8040,8041,B001VGOQZM,If you love licorice....,"This is one of two licorice mints that I would recommend.  They are indeed difficult to find and at this time (6/2011) Amazon does not carry my other favorite, St. Claire's.  Nonetheless, Meltzer's has beneficial herbs and a mild but definite licorice flavor.  Not one of the ""licorice-flavored"" gummy candies.  Two or three of these little hard pastilles, and you're done.  No black tongue either!  Treat yourself, and indulge in these little gems."
8041,8042,B003GYZBK6,Go for it!,"The Butterfinger has been around since it was introduced by the Curtiss Candy Company of Illinois in 1923. In the 1990s, they put a new wrinkle on the trademark by making Butterfinger BBs. Those were good, but they really outdid themselves when they invented the Butterfinger Crisp! The Butterfinger Crisp is made of baked wafers sandwiching layers of Butterfinger flavored cream. Then, the whole thing is wrapped in chocolate.<br /><br />Yeah, this candy bar is great, a real improvement on the original. It has that same great Butterfinger taste, but without that stick-to-teeth consistency. If anything it even tastes better! The normal-sized Butterfinger Crisp contains 210 calories, but a nice thing is that it comes in the form of two bars, which allows you to eat one as a (roughly) 100 calorie snack and save the other one for tomorrow's snack. I wish that they did that with other candy bars.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like Butterfingers, or if you like wafer-candy, then you will like Butterfinger Crisps. Go for it!"
8043,8044,B00374MU8G,Love these,"All of my 3 girls - from the black lab, akita, and pomeranian love these treats. I love them because I can disguise any of the dogs meds in them, and they will still eat it!! Great."
8047,8048,B002PNGY28,Great cat treat that is also good for them,"When a locale store started carrying Wellness products, this was one of them. I purchased a bag and my cats loved it. I went back to the store to buy more and guess what; they were sold out. This was almost a year ago!!! They still have not restocked this product because ""their corporate computers do all the ordering for them"" and not an actual human that knows what sells and what doesn't. Needless to say, this store is a chain pet supply store and well, they have since lost a lot of local business (from me alone) as I have found that I can purchase the same product for much less via Amazon and also get it in as little as a few days."
8067,8068,B0012KB4M0,My dog loves these bones.,"I bought one of these bones for my lab/shepard mix, 65 pound dog, and she loved it.  I bought the first one from Petco and the large size was 8 dollars.  Amazon is over 50% cheaper and there is free shipping.  Before committing to 8 bones, you can do what I did and head on over to your local pet shop to see if they carry these bones and then see if your dog likes them.  It takes my lab about 1 hour to eat the whole bone.  I really like that it breaks into small pieces which eliminates my worries about my dog choking on a big piece of bone."
8078,8079,B000UCIZHS,Damaged spoiled formula!,"We have ordered Elecare from this shipper twice.  The first time, we received it next day and were very happy.  The second time, it arrived next day as well, but two of the cans had opened and the box got wet, causing the inside of the box to be covered in clumps of spoiled formula.  When we used one of the unopened cans (we had to since we had nothing else to feed the baby and this product is not sold in stores) the baby became sick for several days."
8079,8080,B003UKM564,Poor quality beans,"Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.<br /><br />The beans were thin and almost dry.<br /><br />Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper..."
8080,8081,B000H25VR8,Excellent seasoning,"Very tasty, I used it for years, they recently added more red peppers and that's makes it more spicy that I prefer, but it still very good."
8088,8089,B000NY6PPW,Instruction Translation problem solvers,When I lived in Germany I bought this all the time over there. The biggest problem was of course everything was written in German. Since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to English. From there you can use the product.
8091,8092,B000QSORLO,Keeps the pups healthy,"I recently invited a baby mini doxie into my family and had an existing 2 lb. chihuahua that the vet constantly told me to try and fatten up. I would try hamburger and cottage cheese and all the things he told me and she would either get a tummy ache or just not gain weight. I bought this food with the doxie in mind and fed it to the chihuahua too and she started to gain weight within the week. I now have to watch the portions i give her or she will over gain. Two healthy dogs with the help of this food. When the doxie gets older, I will continue to buy the Eukanuba adult brand."
8094,8095,B001SAVOJW,YUMMY,Since I have not been able to eat fat there are many things that I miss eating.  Tortillas were something I ate alot and really missed.  You would never know that these are fat free.  The only complaint that I have is that the tortillas stick together and I have torn many of them.  I would say that in the big picture I would rather have a torn tortilla that no tortilla at all. I plan to reorder when I run out.
8096,8097,B002L2RIQO,Delicious,"One of the best mass produced teas I have tried. Light Keemun flavour, delicious with or without milk and can sit in the pot without tasting stewed. A great bargain in the 6 pack."
8101,8102,B0009WNQ8C,Very Tasty,I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly
8105,8106,B0045GCQJ8,"these little lentils taste terrific, are USDA organic","Very welcome addition to the kitchen cupboard...these USDA organic small black lentils Westbrae Brand come packed to the top in a 15-ounce can and are ready to eat.

What I received from this webpage was small black lentils, not Beluga.  Instead of belugas,I received Vegetarian organic black lentils.  Not that I'm sorry about it; the can label has a wonderful recipe for soup, and a vegetarian diet pyramid for nutrition.  These small black organic lentils are delicious and nourishing.  I recommend them to you to try, and I'd like an opportunity to order and try the Heirloom Beluga lentils as well sometime.  You'll like the small organic black lentils, many ways to serve them."
8106,8107,B0034UCHAY,My dog loves these!,My dog loves greenies and didn't notice the switch from the regular to the lite.  She loves them either way!
8107,8108,B007W0SK3A,great product,"This product is very healthy for your body, it is cost effective because is not mixed with other things, it comes with a little spoon with the right measurement for your drinks. I bought it in Peru, and I want to find it in the US.  Is better than other stevia products I have bought in the past."
8108,8109,B004PISOCY,ColCafe Greaatt Coffee,Taste is much superior to the regular freeze dried that you get in the supermarket.  I would bet you will enjoy the taste as much as we do.
8109,8110,B004ASDNXO,"The best cherry soda, ever!","I love cherry soda, but this product is the best cherry soda  that I have ever tasted.  Sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time.  Try it once, and you will be hooked for good."
8110,8111,B0000EIE2Z,BEST BLUEBERRIES,"In the winter when fresh blueberries exceed our food budget these dried blue berries are fine for muffins, breads and puddings.<p>  We also enjoy fruit on our cereal.  In the winter it is often oatmeal and we sprinkle these blueberries on a bowl of oatmeal - wonderful on a cold morning."
8111,8112,B005QKH18I,Really good,Was pleasantly surprised at how good these pretzels were.There are 3 servings per bag at 140 calories each.This is about 14 to 15 pretzels.The pretzels are really filling.The bag has approximately 45 pretzels.I was expecting them to be bland since they are made with natural ingredients but they are very flavorful.Made in the USA is a big plus.
8113,8114,B000YTEE36,Longest Lasting Gum on the market,Five Gum is a new product from Wrigley's. I'm always on the lookout for new gum since I like having something to chew while I'm driving. I came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong.
8114,8115,B004W7T9VI,Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample."
8120,8121,B0019GVYR2,Aluminum free baking soda,I had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on Amazon.  It was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes. (which I really appreciated and will use) Very pleased with this product.
8141,8142,B002GWMA08,Just o.k.,"Purchased three pounds.  Arrived well packaged.  Am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend.  This is good, but not great...we'll keep on looking."
8155,8156,B000A3TVBQ,Royal Canin--Not the crown jewels of dog food,"I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a  small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs.  First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag."
8156,8157,B001IZA8S0,Great tasting tea.,"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.<br /><br />This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.<br /><br />Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review."
8160,8161,B001HTR4WA,Ridiculously Expensive!!,"A pack of 18 on any of Horizon's flavors, cost about $15.00 this is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!! But the product itself is EXCELLENT!!"

8167,8168,B000E1588O,EXCELLENT Herbal Tea!,"I love this product. Tazo has produced a mild, yet sweet and spicy tea that I can only call magic. Sweet Cinnamon Spice has a flavor all on it's own, and I highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance."

8180,8181,B002X4HNQU,no smell extract,"I purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. The product has no sweet smell as one would expect. I have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier, no response."
8181,8182,B000G7M4U6,Great Deal,Ordered these seeds for a recipe that I got from my grandmother. Seeds came very quickly and well packaged. Much cheaper than buying all those small bottles at the grocery store. Would definatly use this company again.
8182,8183,B000RY8Z88,Amazing stuff!,"I grew up in upstate NY where this stuff was born. It is pretty much a regional favorite that just hasn't caught on yet - and aside from here, upstate NY is the only place to get it. What you do is use the Spiedie sauce to marinate cubes of chicken overnight, then just grill them up, slide 'em on a soft italian roll and add some mayo. Bam! Good eats! I use this stuff at home in the DC area and I would highly recommend the marinade to anyone looking for a something different in their chicken!"
8184,8185,B0001GV57U,Two Favorite Food Groups,"I love chipotle. Back here in MA when I live now, it was years before you could find any products with chipotle. Things are better now, but I still have to fetch chipotle things in CA. And I was so ticked off when TSA would not let me take this stuff on the plane. So I have been forced to order this stuff online for years. Of all my sauces though this one is my go to favorite. And it is the roasted garlic-it is a real sauce changer. It adds a complexity to the sauce that is really just different. But I love roasted garlic too. So the best of two worlds combined. I keep other hot sauces around for different ethnic foods, but when I eat hummus (which is a lot) this is the one I reach for in the fridge."
8185,8186,B0032GRU16,Good Energy,"This energy drink has worked for me. I drink one in the morning for my drive to work, and one before I work out at night. Grape is OK, fruit punch is better."
8186,8187,B001EX9LGQ,Crack for Kitties,Our cats just love this stuff.  They eat the Ultra Premium dry food and Ocean Fish canned food.  We've given them some of the other formulas and they'd slowly eat them but they won't leave the Ocean Fish alone.
8188,8189,B001E0SCFU,Very good snack,"Tried this for the first time last night and really liked it , it had a great taste . Good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet . bought them in the grocer for 7.99 . I thought that was expensive ..Hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere"
8189,8190,B000FFILBA,Tastes more like a green than an oolong,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."
8190,8191,B002EPWH96,Perfect for so many things,"A classic Pasta Amatriciana requires this beautiful and mild form of bacon, and as with every other product I have purchased from them, La Quercia has nailed Guanciale.<br /><br />A little guanciale, rendered a bit but still tender, some diced tomatoes, a little peccorino romano, a pinch of crushed red pepper, and you are done.  The guanciale is the star, and this guanciale really stands up.  Served with bucatini pasta, and you might as well be in Rome."
8191,8192,B000LKZ84W,Silken tofu,"Silken tofu is so versatile: creamy salad dressing, sauce, etc.  So glad I purchased it at Amazon.  The price was excellent, packing fine and delivery quick."
8200,8201,B004MSNXSM,Mini is not mini,When I read the description of this it said mini - these are regular size.  Tastes great but my 86 year old mom wants the mini ones and I have not been able to find the smaller dine size ones.
8201,8202,B003ALJTNU,Hands-Down Favorite Treats,"Our two Shih Tzu pups love Ziggies more than any other treat. We have given them Ziggies from the time we brought them home four years ago and truly, nothing makes them happier than when they hear the wrappers crinkle on these treats.  We give them these special treats when we leave for work in the morning and/or before we head out for a while in the evening.  Often we just split one treat in half to share between the two.  Ziggies aren't always readily available to order in the bulk cube and we've gone to great lengths to find them to keep our pups happy and in constant supply because they really bring joy to their little faces.<br /><br />You can use them to stuff into the rubber Kong things but we don't use them that way - we did when they were little but stopped bothering after a few weeks."
8205,8206,B004T72GUC,Excellent Gift Set of Fine Green Tea,"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012"
8206,8207,B000BXUVYG,"Caused my normally ""iron"" kitty to vomit :(","My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my ""human"" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!<br /><br />I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore."
8231,8232,B001EO64ZQ,Sugar Water?,"i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then ""drink up""..blech."
8246,8247,B000E15DFM,Back to Nature Harvest Whole Wheats,"If you like Triscuit crackers, then this is the healthy version with the same great taste and texture. Amazingly there is not much of a price difference (12-9.5oz for 33.36 vs. 12-8.5 oz. for 29.83)to purchase the better quality cracker. If the coupon offer is in effect, then these crackers are also the price winner! The only disadvantage is since I think these are healthy, I eat more of them at one time than I would normally of the other brand. They are sooooo tasty w/ melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip. Enjoy!"
8260,8261,B0056GL0MA,WAY TWO  SWEET,"I WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET THIS THEN I HAD A CUP, I NEVER MADE IT THRU THE CUP...<br />IT IS SO SWEET IT IS SICKENING REALLY, NOW I HAVE TO FIND FAMILY TO PAWN THIS STUFF ONTO<br />AND CHRISTMAS IS A LONG WAY OFF...LOL"
8261,8262,B0047OYR8G,Excellent!,"My son has nut allergies and US made are not safe for him since early childhood...now 19...The British...Nestle Co. have made a treat for him...thrilled to have his favorite and in DARK, great...and quick service and delivery!"
8262,8263,B004W1HBZU,Top is loose and doesn't poor freely,"The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow.  This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out.  I just lift the top up a little when I poor to bypass this problem.  The glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy.  I got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass, which looked terrible, but is easily disassembled to clean.  There is no stop for the screw so over tightening during reassembly could break the glass."
8263,8264,B000VK6NDC,"Good quality Pet food, PETA APPROVED!","My cats love the food, and it's on the HAPPY list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" linked through the PETA site, peta.org.  That is VERY reassuring."
8284,8285,B003VXFK44,Absolutely delicious coffee!,"I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!"
8739,8740,B000LKZ84C,"Great shelf life, very good for general use","I use this product frequently.  Like most tofu, you need to press it (between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine) to get the excess water out.  The more water you can remove, the less you'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like.<br /><br />As for a blank slate on taste, that's exactly what makes tofu great.  It will take on any flavor you want to impart.  Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice.  A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc).  You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce.  The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu.  Even a half hour in the bag works fine.<br /><br />We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or ""brown"" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired).  Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too.<br /><br />Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill.<br /><br />Plain tofu ""creams"" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness.  We've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs.<br /><br />We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe.  General Tso's Tofu is AWESOME.  The flavor comes from the sauce so you don't need to marinate first.<br /><br />Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency.<br /><br />Tofu is all about how you prepare it.  Most people will NOT like it plain, so don't expect to just dig a fork into it.<br /><br />This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life.  I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer.  They don't last as long in the house, though, so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry (usually dated a few to several months out)."
8758,8759,B00469VTOW,"Taste like granola, not sugar","Even with the chocolate chunks, these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and I really appreciated that.<br /><br />They have 110 calories each and 8 grams sugar which is less than Kudos Chocolate Chip (120 cal, 12 sugar) or a Cascadian Farms Chocolate Chip granola bar (140 cal, 10 sugar).  When I need a quick snack, I can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and I feel full until the next meal.  If I need a quick meal I eat one of these with two string cheeses, a large apple and water -- I can make it until dinner.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack."
8759,8760,B004CHDH3O,Delicious and sugar free.,"These tiny candies are as delicious as they are presentable. Every single kind of them tastes great! They are packaged well. When I am through the bag, I am ordering it again!!"
8760,8761,B003KSWEHG,Strong Green Tea,"This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3-4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores."
8761,8762,B004OLUCAE,Disagreeable Taste,"Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste?"
8764,8765,B0036GG73Y,Cost too much,"Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this!"
8765,8766,B005CM84XQ,Be cautious,Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.
8766,8767,B000WS1AJA,Raspberry Dream Tea,"Take the warm scent of Italian Bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into South Indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea. This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. This is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
8767,8768,B008S5LR0G,Really Good Juice!,I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
8768,8769,B000MGSJ5A,"Gluten free, vegan, kosher, and very concentrated.","O.k., so it's not officially kosher--but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell-O if you think about it too much.<br /><br />Now foods is a company that sells gluten-free stuff, and this is no exception:  if you have celiac this won't make you sick.<br /><br />Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar.  That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.<br /><br />However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin.  (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is:  seaweed.)"
8779,8780,B004X8TE66,Better than Oreos,"We have been looking for a good chocolate sandwich cookie since Hydrox are no longer being made or sold, and Famous Amos fits the bill.  Much better than Oreos or other types, it is sweet, the chocolate is distinct and the filling is not too sweet as if it is made of only sugar.  The Amazon price is the best, subscribe and save is new and brings the price down to an irresistible buy, which is even more special since these cookies are not always at the grocery"
8780,8781,B00434FTDM,Pretty good chicken gumbo,"Progresso's chicken gumbo soup doesn't taste all that great when it comes out of the microwave (or off the stove, if that's your way), but it tastes pretty good. It has white meat chicken, kidney beans, okra, rice, celery, carrot, tomato, and red bell pepper in it, as you can see from the picture on the can. Check the picture I uploaded to see what the soup *actually* looks like in the bowl. The chicken was pretty firm and just right, in my bowl. The gumbo taste isn't bad. You won't feel like you're in Louisiana or Memphis while you're eating it (unless you're actually IN Louisiana or Memphis), but it has the distinctive gumbo taste and is really quite good compared to some of Progresso's other soups. My biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy, as they tend to with Progresso soups, I've found. The celery and okra were good, just very soft and mushy, which isn't really what I wanted. It did a pretty good job of filling me up, though, as they pack a whole lot into that can as always. Overall a good soup that I wouldn't mind buying more of if I see it on the shelves sometime."
8782,8783,B003G5CUOU,Addictive and tasty,"I am doing the ""subscribe and save"" thing with these crackers. I thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes, but boy was I wrong. Already we're halfway through the boxes. Time to order more!"
8784,8785,B002RYVK24,Duck Rillettes - not much flavor,I bought duck rillettes from Amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop.com. I was expecting a really good rillette. Full flavored rillette. What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes.
8785,8786,B002P59VSA,Awesome,"I love this tea. I hated my friends asking me if I was pregnant. I decided to diet but wasn't easy. I was always hungry and at bedtime I couldn't help it and ended up with a plate of ice cream... no good. I decided to give this tea a try and I stopped feeling hungry all the time. The taste is great. I have lost ten pounds in almost two months. I walked al least an hour per day, I only have fruits and tea in the mornings, salad and protein for lunch and fresh smoothies without sugar for dinner. If I feel hungy I have a fruit or raw vegetable. I put chopped garlic on my salads, it gets rid of waste too. I dont diet on weekends but my stomach is smaller so I get full with less and less food. I am buying this for my sister It has been awesome for me. thanks!"
8790,8791,B000M5PP8U,A decent spice rub for red meats...,"As a spice mix fan, I make a point of trying multiple products on food - both fun and fattening in equal measure!  I've also highlighted what I think are the standout mixes in Chef Tom's line: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.<br /><br />That said, this mix is a delicious treat, but it doesn't hold the attention of the taste buds like the standouts.  The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>."
8795,8796,B0000GJ7CQ,Aguas Frescas,"This product is OK, I think it has too much sugar and the flavor is not that strong.<br />I enjoyed it, but did not meet my expectations."
8796,8797,B000ZILM3G,Great glass!  Great Tea!,"I was skeptical because I've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this.  But I'm glad I jumped in and decided to purchase it.  First of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift-wrapped free which is cool.  Second, the glass works great which is most important.  Its double-walled so when I poured my boiling hot water in the glass I had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth.  The filter/strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea.  This is the first time I've used something like this and it works perfectly for me.<br /><br />The blooming tea comes in three small containers.  I'm new to tea so I can't tell what kind it is...most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good.  The first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out.  Anyway I hope this helps people that are on the fence like I was about buying glasses like this.  This package is legit and well worth the price."
8800,8801,B00512X6V2,Best GF Pasta.,Just be aware that it's quite expensive for the amount that you're getting (less than a pound of pasta per package).
8801,8802,B001EO7JFU,"I just recieved the product (Oct. 20, 2009)","and the expiration date on top of the can says Jan.06,05. I cannot even return it since it is a grocery. Amazon, are you serious?"
8808,8809,B0028621BU,Overpriced - not 18lb bags!,"When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!"
8809,8810,B003QRGDV4,Great grain free food,"If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost."
8810,8811,B001HTE3GK,The shipping cost is a joke.,"I'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip-off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case."
8811,8812,B00060PTLO,Low-cost Latte,Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.
8844,8845,B00465VT3M,French Roast Coffee,"Love this coffee, good flavor. The large quantity lasts longer then the smaller boxes so I don't have to order as frequently. It did ship quickly too :) I would order again!"
8845,8846,B003LUZ07O,a wonderful treat for the pups,"these arrived very quickly & i was excited to see how the pups would like them.  i like that there are so many in the package.  i've always held in high regard anything rawhide & sweet potato so this was a no brainer....our pups love both!  these sticks are the best!  they incorporate chewing, gnawing, flavor & fun.  i definitely would buy these again."
8846,8847,B002SRUYL8,Mediocre,Not quiet what I was expecting.  The cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy.  The dark chocolate was good but too crunchy.
8847,8848,B0048IAKP0,Awesome,Gravy could be a little thicker but the taste is great. The price isn't bad either. Makes great sailsbury steaks and stroganof.
8849,8850,B003639FQ8,Great Sauce,This sauce has one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  There's a good balance between spice and garlic.  It has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things.  I'm not a big fan of most Habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly.
8850,8851,B00125NM8Y,"Roses Lime Juice the ""Original""","Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the ""Original"" !"
8851,8852,B000UJ88LO,"Good, but not great","I purchased this as a gamble, because there was NO product information listed, so I had no idea how much I was getting or exactly what was in it.  I was disappointed that the  ""large"" tin, was not all that large.  It was a round tin, approximately 4 inches tall, and maybe 7 or 8 inches across.  I was hoping that Large, especially for the price, would be one of the large and tall tins.  It's difficult to tell from the picture.  The product itself was good, but for the price, I was expecting more.  I'd probably buy from them again."
8852,8853,B001QDD2IM,"Not real wasabi, but butter than what's available.","This is the best of the ready-made kinds.  In my experience, the powdered kinds are truly awful.  The other ready-made brands taste like pure yellow mustard. This one is made with horseradish and no real wasabi, but it works well with sushi.<br /><br />It also makes a great cocktail sauce for shrimp when mixed with plain old Ketchup and a pinch of Old Bay Seafood Seasoning."
8854,8855,B002HG6Z8Q,"Good, but no comparison to other WOW's!","I am on a gluten free diet but even before I learned I was sensitive, I LOVED some of the WOW cookies. My two favorites are the ginger and the oatmeal which I would rate 5 star because both are fantastic! Who doesn't love chocolate chip  cookies....right? I know I always have but the texture and flavor of the WOW chocolate chip cookies is just ok in my opinion and my daughter and husband both agree although they are my granddaughter's favorite and I'm pretty sure if she was over 13 (she's 6) she would do her own review and it would be 5 star!"
8858,8859,B00180O980,Economical and my cat loves it,"Cats are finicky animals and what one loves another won't touch - that is not a reflection on the food itself. I have two Burmese and their eating habits are very different. My local Pet Nutrition Center kindly gave me a sample of Prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it, the other won't touch it. That's why samples are nice. Both of my cats have been on Evo kibble, but this one cat who now loves the Prowl, has a habit of throwing up and I'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down. So far, no barf. She also laps it up as soon as I've added warm water - no waiting. I highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide, as the food is economical as well as healthy."
8860,8861,B001QW6LMW,Dog Approved,My dogs absolutely love this. I have been looking for a natural healthy food to store in my camper in case of emergency. Last year with all the wildfires I decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs. I have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room. I read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try. My dogs let me know its supper time when I get home now because they are all about this food.
8866,8867,B001EQ5EQE,The best decaf ever,"This is really the best decaf I have tried... It is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or Illy. Unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like Folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason French Roast, Italian Roast etc... (believe me, they have nothing to do with French or Italian coffee). Not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings..."
8898,8899,B0092X7OGY,The black bean rules!,"The Jelly Belly people actually put real licorice in these jelly beans. There is usually only one of the licorice beans in a bag of assorted beans, so if you love licorice, you can buy them solo. These are authentic tasting and really good. You can't beat Jelly Belly for flavor."
8902,8903,B0054TWR9O,Great for busy families,"I have 3 children under the age of 8 and work fulltime, so we are always on the go.  The Happymorning product line has helped us immensely, not just in the mornings, but for afternoon snacks as well.  It is an easy way for my kids to grab a healthy snack while completing homework before we rush out the door to afternoon practices.  It is also an easy snack to toss in their lunchboxes and I do not have to worry about what they are eating while at school because they are not going to trade away their favorite snack! The Super Banana in particular is my childrens' favorite - they often fight over the last one!"
8904,8905,B0043P126O,Perfect fo my little dog,"These treats are perfect for my little dog.  I tried the assorted flavors, and it was too much for his sensitive stomach.  The plan treats are perfect.  He's only 10-11 lbs, so these small treats are just right for his size.  I used to run out before I'd remember to buy more, so I am doing Amazon's subscribe and save.  No more worries about running out."
8907,8908,B009D668KS,real Diet Dr. Pepper,"My package was mailed out 1st and received on the 3rd in perfect condition. The tap fit the BIB with no trouble or leaks and is very easy to operate. I had a few questions; I emailed and received answers fast by the owner. The 1 gallon box of syrup is much smaller than I thought it would be, about the size of a medium cheese cake box. What I do is drain syrup into a washed out Sodastream container and store it in the fridge. The Sodastream syrup cap has 3 circles in it, bottom, second and top. The top circle is 2 oz. so you would fill it to that 3 times just remember after carbonating you water you remove 4 oz of water or the 1 liter bottle will over flow when adding the 6 oz. of syrup. 1 gallon BIBs are a good way to test if this is right for you before paying high price for the 5 gallon BIBs."
8908,8909,B000S9K0IA,my cats love this product,It is not cheap... probably a little overpriced... but very high quality ingredients. NO meat by products
8910,8911,B000PIQ1HS,One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally,"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.<br /><br />With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."
8911,8912,B004OVCWAW,"These are NOT granola, but are very good","Oats, for those who may not know, are a grain with a size and shape like barley or 'fat rice'. There are three basic ways that the oat groats are prepared: rolled, steel cut, and ground. In the US, rolled oats are the predominant form and are the type found in the Quaker Oats box or granola. Steel cut oats are associated with Ireland and are basically oats that have been chopped into even sized pieces. Ground oats, associated with Scotland, are just that - ground into relatively fine pieces. These crackers are made with ground oats, olive oil, wheat flour, wheat bran, skim milk solids, salt, and baking soda. Note that there is no sugar and that salt is listed at the end. These are not the kind of cracker that you eat plain (although I enjoy them that way), but instead are designed to be used as a base for a canape, or served with a bit of jam if you want sweetness. These are simple oat cakes that may not appeal to the American taste buds accustomed to sweet, flavored, salty crackers. They are delicious and wholesome and make a good snack."
8914,8915,B000LLIVKO,Whee-Doggy,"This is the only way to fry fish.  If you start cooking with your fire too high, the fish will not get those annoying burn marks.  The fish fries evenly, a nice golden brown.  It adheres to the fish well and does not come off when flipping to the other side.  It tastes good.  I add a pinch of old bay seasoning and a pinch of sugar, shake up the mixture and then add the fish and shake again.  We have been using this stuff for years and I make perfect fish every time."
8916,8917,B002BUEN2S,"On the verge of being good, but something's missing","I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa."
8918,8919,B0011ULFVG,Very easy to get what I want,"After several less successful stews with curry powder, I turned to this curry sauce mix.<br />It is incredibly easy to get delicious curry stew with simple food stuffs, only with my basic cooking skills while imitating the way of cooking curry in animes.<br />Though it is my philosophy that good cuisine should be made from scratch, but his time I just surrendered to its convenience to get exactly the taste I want with such a simple process.<br />One small problem is that it is too mild for me though it is labeled medium hot."
8920,8921,B004FZX2YC,Disapointed,"We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant.<br />We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop."
8922,8923,B001DGH03A,Buy These Now!,"These are the best chocolate chips I've ever tasted in my life.  Yes, they are pricey but it doesn't matter because they last forever and you use about half the amount of the regular ones due to the richness of them.  So so so good.  If you love chocolate, you will love these chips."
8923,8924,B000JWEE74,"Ate all 8 pieces in &lt;48 hours. Hit the spot for cravings, stomach not so happy...","...but they were very tasty. They arrived a bit soft, which was fine, as it is warmer out. I opened the first one and was surprised by how good it was. Usually I am less than impressed with sugar free products. But these hit the spot...for five minutes. Then, I was craving another piece. Second one was just as good. Third and fourth followed pretty quickly as well. If you like your caramels super chewy and soft, then you don't need to refrigerate these. I didn't refrigerate the first four pieces. The second four, I stuck them in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I had one as a pre-coffee snack. I couldn't have just one at a time and I ate my second one soon after. The refrigerated ones were just as good, if you like your caramels a little harder. Unfortunately, since I scarfed down this bag so fast, my stomach is not happy with me. And I am unhappy as I have no more caramels. If you are craving caramels, don't want the sugar, don't mind the maltitol effects, and can be content with one caramel a day, then these are for you."
8926,8927,B001E1AKMM,Very fresh tea,The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
8927,8928,B009AVDFCK,"Great price, great gift","The 12 pack is a great gift idea because Omaha Steaks packages them in two boxes of 6.  This makes it cheaper than the 6 pack if you are buying more than one quantity.  Omaha is always fast at shipping too.  Though I've had other Omaha Steaks products, I have only purchased these as gifts, so I can't comment on taste."
8930,8931,B002OKW5GQ,Plant in a Can,"Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product."
8931,8932,B0060AOSGG,A Hit!,"My grandchildren LOVE the sour gummy vitamins. They really liked the sour gummy worms by Rhino, but alas, I can't find them. These were a good second choice. The big problem is keeping them from eating more than 2!"
8932,8933,B002UFVXPE,Excellent service,"I was glad to know that amazon has this product in their groceries section.<br />Though the shipping was individually priced, don't know whether there was any option to pack the glass jars.<br />Anyway, I liked the fast service."

8934,8935,B0007A0AP8,The price is right,"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU"">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.  He can't get enough of them.<br /><br />We also tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a> made by Zuke's.  He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies.<br /><br />I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog.  Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well.  These are highly recommended.<br /><br />[Edit: August 14, 2011]<br /><br />He still loves them!<br /><br />We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had.  These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.  Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer.<br /><br />[Edit: September 29, 2012]<br /><br />Anyone else notice that they seem different??  The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle.  They also weren't as potent as the other ones were.  He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.  I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed.  I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.  A little disappointed..."
8989,8990,B005CT9GMC,Excellent tea!,"This blueberry and vanilla tea is excellent! I love all kinds of tea, and friend gave me some of this blueberry and vanilla (and a couple other Dilmah varieties).  They're all great, but this is one of my favorites.  The blueberry vanilla taste is delicious but not overpowering.  I usually add milk and sugar to my tea, but this one doesn't need it.  I highly recommend it!"
8990,8991,B001QED11E,excellent choice for my dog's 'special' treat,"Bought through Amazon as Snap-Bits are difficult to find in pet stores.  My dog is on a diet and the only treats she can have are few Cheerios, baby carrots cut into little pieces (and yes she eats them) and ice cubes.  Snap-bits are her extra special treat and she knows when they are in my hand.  She really likes it when I roll one along the floor for her to chase after and chomp it down."

While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!"
9448,9449,B000HEA94Q,my Pomeranian loves these treats!,"My Pomeranian loves these treats... he eats one every morning!  They do smell a little, but that is probably why he loves to eat them. I've ordered these many times and never had a problem with them being opened when they arrive."
9452,9453,B000ZPOXCQ,Terrific cassoulet,I purchased this cassoulet for my wife's birthday dinner. I never tried this brand of cassoulet before. It was delicious. The sausage was excellent. The duck was good. The general flavor was superb.
9453,9454,B000N648QS,My cats love this stuff..,"Excellent quality pet food with no inert ingredients, filler or potentially unhealthy meat by-products. I used to have to travel several zip codes away to buy it, and it was well worth the trip to give them food I was confident was of the highest quality. My cats can't get enough of it and the price is very competitive, especially if you are a Prime member.<br /><br />Still in doubt? Try this test:<br /><br />Open a can of your current cat food and smell it.. then compare that to any flavor of Merrick. It won't turn your stomach.<br /><br />When it says fish, there are huge chunks of -you guessed it- fish. Not a weird extruded-looking grey or stinky brown paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end, but actual food in a can. Speaking of which, the post meal 'litter box stink' period is dramatically reduced as well, as is fecal volume. Less to clean :)<br /><br />Give it a try.. remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition, but your cats will thank you for it."

9456,9457,B000UBDKII,Better than most Douwe Egberts blends,"I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend."
9508,9509,B0037QTLU4,old timey goodness,"this stuff is terrific!  it's been at least 20 years since i have seen damson plum, jelly or jam, in stores in my area. the taste of AMISH MADE damson plum jam was just as i remember.  it has a smooth texture and is sweet without being too sweet. i will order this brand again."
9511,9512,B0005XOJEA,GREAT!,"This is the second time I have ordered from them, and again, the service was wonderful!  I was impressed with how well everything was packaged, and also with how quickly I received my order.  I'll be ordering again from them!  Thank you!"
9514,9515,B0001M10OW,The best baking powder you can buy.,"If you go to the Rumford web site, you will see this:<br /><br />""In 1859, Eben Norton Horsford (1818-1893), a co-founder of The Rumford Company, formulated and patented Rumford Baking Powder, the first calcium phosphate baking powder. [...] Rumford Baking Powder quickly became widely accepted since it achieved more dependable results and was less expensive than using crude formulas of cream of tartar and baking soda. The calcium acid phosphate in Rumford Baking Powder was also considered to be healthier than cream of tartar.""<br /><br />I had really disliked baking with regular baking powder since it was soapy and bitter tasting.  This powder has no such problems and it works great.  Also, it has no aluminum in it, unlike most commercial baking powders.  I discovered that many chefs and professional bakers use it, so I was happy to find a superior alternative to the regular, common baking powders on the market."

He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's breakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.<br /><br />this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.<br /><br />as for me, i love this food b/c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty--dooty? hehe)"

Imagine that - a guilty treat like a cheese doodle is now a healthy alternative!"
9538,9539,B004T9YUVS,Disappointed,This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again
9539,9540,B000JSQKNE,Chili pickle,"This reminded me how much I enjoy Indian pickle.  It was basically good pickle.<br />Problems:<br />* it seemed a bit stale<br />* it was fairly pricey<br />But it did remind me that I really like Indian pickle, and told me that I could get it on the internet, so I poked around a bit and found a place (ishopindia.com) in another suburb of Chicago which was closer (Skokie; I live in Oak Park) so instead of it coming from Texas, it came from Skokie (less than an hour's drive away).  That solved the staleness problem.  Their prices seemed to be about 2/3 of Amazon's prices.  I thank Amazon for reminding me that I should look."

I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!"

9546,9547,B001EQ5IPQ,Straight from the coconut!,"Without a doubt, this is hands down the best coconut water product I've tried.  The others I've experienced have a flat or slightly bitter taste but this one has that subtle essence and sweetness of coconut water drank directly from a freshly opened raw coconut.  Let me tell you, this is the most refreshing, hydrating, and re-energizing elixir you can partake of.  I'll take this over Gatorade any day of the week.  Great way to start off any day."

Although a different brand than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog-snack-looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldn't finish even one chip.<br /><br />I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money!"
9575,9576,B000V6FTT0,I Still Like It Despite The Problems.....,"As another reviewer noted when you heat this product in the microwave, you MUST keep an eye on it.  It tips; it pops and eventually spills all over.  However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.  Comparing the price per each on Amazon vs. a local store finds it much cheaper here on Amazon.  I recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too."
9578,9579,B000TFKMSG,Where are you Stride Fruit Gum?,it is too bad that I can't find this product locally any longer.  It was a favorite in our household.  Now my source is Amazon and I'm just as happy with that as I was before.  It has a great flavor that is long lasting.

They need no feeding, pruning, watering or plant care, merely cosmetic care. For those of us who don't have the time, patience or skill to cultivate plants, these make a nice surrogate, and they make nice gifts, too. Preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars. This one is double-trunked, reasonably priced, and very attractive."
9588,9589,B002PO09MS,Fondarific Fondant,"I bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant.  We used gel colors to make several different colors, and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant.  We didn't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results.  The other thing I liked was this fondant was not hard to work with.  If you can work with playdoh, then you can work with this fondant.  AND it tasted good, too!  I have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty, but you peel it off before you eat your cake.  With this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it.  This is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good."
9611,9612,B004JHIBV0,Checked off my bucket list,"When I first heard of Kopi Luwak coffee I was horrified, but then the idea grew on me and I decided I really wanted to try it, so on my bucket list it went.  To purchase this same package directly from the producer is nearly twice the price.  There's not really 16 servings per package, maybe half that.  It is pretty amazing coffee and I'm thrilled I tried it.  Remember when shopping for Kopi Luak coffe make sure you're getting 100% civit coffee and not a blend which can have as little at 1 or 2% Kopi Luwak coffee.  Check out realkopiluwak.com for info on how civit coffee is produced and how to brew the perfect cup."

9634,9635,B001COE2RU,delicious!!,"This is one of the best mixed nut blends I have ever had!<br />Everything tastes extremely fresh and natural. The flavor combination is amazing - perfect mix of nuts and dried fruits. I really like that this blend doesn't include peanuts - I'm tired of nut blends always including peanuts... enough already! This was a refreshing change and a great snack.<br />I also feel the price is reasonable - considering there are no peanuts, everything is natural, and it tastes great!"

My wife tried the other half. Ditto. The next day, we tried a full tablet, letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue. I found the tablets pretty tasty themselves, while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy. Anyway, again there was no effect with lemons, chili sauce, etc. Our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods.<br /><br />Happily for me, the company is going to refund me for the other three packages. But I would have preferred that they'd worked. I was looking forward to bringing them out at an upcoming party."
9740,9741,B000KFXEYE,AMAZING!,"This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean."
9816,9817,B000UJG79Y,CHANGED THE FORMULA - TOTALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCT,"This is a horrible step by POP to change the formula.  They now use cheap 'maltose' (barley malt sugar - HIGH glycemic 105) in place of most of the honey, and only a miniscule amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula.  HUGE disappointment, and shame on POP for corporatizing and cheapening their once-outstanding products.<br /><br />As with the other reviewer, I once recommended this to everyone.  Now I will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by Prince of Peace.  Try Source Naturals Wellness homeopathic cough formulas - they're much cleaner and work pretty well."

ENJOY.. just keep in mind just as other cereals it has lots of sugars and proccesed carbs so eat wise and stay sharp.
9838,9839,B0007OVXLO,Slurp,"I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory."
9840,9841,B000VTOE3E,A Dog's Best Friend,"These fruit filled rawhide donuts are wonderful. Our yellow lab goes nuts when we just take one out of the pantry! Best eaten outside or on the kitchen floor, not carpeting,  because little pieces of the fruit do drop out during the feast. Our dog loves the fruity part so much he licks them up!<br />A dog may be man's best friend, but these are definitely a dog's best friend!  Can't recommend them enough!"
9841,9842,B004JBB22G,My dogs love it!,Easy to follow directions. The grass grew fast and strong. My dogs are eating it right now and I know it safe and healthy!
9845,9846,B001EQ5KRM,"Bright flavor, smooth on the palate","I tasted this Matcha from Rishi the first time today. The flavor is bright, assertive and fresh. It mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids, leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was whisked. The tea powder is fine, giving it smoothness, no grittiness or grainy feel. I had it both in water and with milk; in both the flavor was not muddied. The flavor is more intense (bold) than most Matcha I've had, making others seem bland by comparison. Nothing off-putting, just seems more concentrated. It has a good crisp green color, and each packet holds about one tablespoon of Matcha. I am glad this order was for a pack of 2 because I can see myself going through one box quickly."
9849,9850,B000LR4HYW,Y U M M Y...........B U T......I ' V E......T A S T E D.......B E T T E R,"I waited quite a while before following my impuslse to buy SMOKED SALMON AND SPINACHE MOUSSE, manufactured by GOURMETFOODSTORE.  Of course, it's expensive, and I ahd to save up for it.  And it's quite caloric, as well.  However, the picture of this gourmet treat finally DID get to me, and...after returning to this picture and this product several time.....couldn't resist it any longer.  For me, it was my ""royal treat"", to celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton!<br /><br />Well, my package arrived a bit after the wedding, (today, actually) --but that's because I ordered it a bit after the wedding, (May 6, to be exact.)  I kept reminding myself how expensive this really is, and how even the Queen saves money whenever, and wherever, she can....but it was no good.  I had to at least TRY this stuff...at least once...<br /><br />The package, marked ""Perishable"", had stood out in my hallway for a few hours, as I was out this morning.  Upon opening the outer cardboard box, then the inner styrofoam box, (repleate with cold-bags, to keep the pershable food inside fresh),  I came across a small brown-cardboard box which held my Smoked Salmon Mousse.  Inside, was not one big package, as I had expected, but, instead -- to my delight -- sixt small black plastic tubs!  It seems, happily, that no matter how much you order of this Somoked Salmon Mousse, it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs.  The black contrasts nicely with the Smoked Salmon Mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label, that almost -- but not quite -- covers the food within.  The label says ""Terroirs d'Antan"" in big letterss, and I take it this means ""land"" of Antan, (and not ""terrors"" therefrom),<br />as ""terre"" means ""land"" in French.  Three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central ""Terroir's d'Antan"" are ""inhabiting"" the yellow label, and we can see, in the far right distance, a huge building that looks like a French chateau -- and, indeed, right below this, in smaller letters, are the words,<br />""The selection 'Terroirs d'Antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of France.  Enjoy.""  But further down the label, it is revealed that the product was 'Made in USA - Distrib by Optimus, Inc., Miami Fl  33138.<br /><br />The larger box in which this individual serving, (actually, containing 3 servings -- 7 ounces), black plastic box came, described the contents as being ""Packed in Aspic"".  And so it is.  When the vaccum-packing, transparent plastic covering is removed, there still is another transparent layer to be removed.  My own experience with ""aspic"" had heretofore been, mainly, with learning of the title of a movie, ""A Dandy In Aspic"", starring the late, (and really great), Laurence Harvey.  I have yet to see the movie -- and have never, really, known what 'aspic' is, exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff.  Well -- I discovered, upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse, that it is similar to the temporary, plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings, but are (somewhat) easily removed.  A type of transparent jello, actually -- about 1/8 inch thick.<br /><br />Well, finally I had the mousse in front of me, and it was time to eat it!<br /><br />The flavour was milder rhan I had expected -- perhaps because ""Cream Cheese"" is the first ingredient.  The smoked salmon flavour DOES come through, on occasion, and it is a nice, dark, smoked salmon flavour, indeed!  But there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here.  (Maybe my taste buds came upon a ""pocket"" of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese.  In any event, this product should have been labled as ""Cream Cheese and Salmon Mousee"", because ""cream cheese"" is the first ingredient listed, and ""smoked salmon"" is the eighth ingredient listed, (out of 17 ingredients), and ""spinach"" is the fourteenth.  (This product was made in the USA, remember -- and if I remember correctly, ingredients here must be listed in descending order.  But -- does this<br />""in size"" order apply to titles too?  If not, it should...<br /><br />The smoked salmon mousse has, again, a very MILD flavour.  it tastes very UNsimilar to the NY-type ""lox"" I had hoped it would.  Here, the amount of cream-cheese SO overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion, that it ALMOST tastes like exotically spiced, and flavoured, cream cheese!<br /><br />The little black ""tubs"", however, are definitely re-usable.  Of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner, they are happily made of ""No. 5"" plastic.  According to an ""Organic Gardening"" article I read a while back, ONLY No. 5, or No. 6 plastic are safe to reuse.  So, these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets, stray coins, business cards, tea-bags, or any other similar object(s).  They can also be used as ""portion-control"" containers, as they hold not-too-much, and not-too-little of any food -- including, (for reference), about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre<br />trays for<br /><br />""Vita"" foods, (available in New York's Waldbaum's supermarkets, and probably other areas as well, sells a someked salmon and cream-cheese spread, at 8 ounces for under $3.  Ir does not have spinach, chives, eggs, tomato, or many of the other ingredients in this Smoked Salmon Mousse, sold by GourmetFoodStore. It comes in a white, round plastic tub.  As it has more smoked slamon in it, it tastes more like smoked salmon to me.  As it's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land-based store, I certainly hope Amazon will offer this VITA product, and others, (like their herring in wine sauce), soon.  otherwise, I'll save up for, and load up on, this Vita product when next I go to Walbaum's.  The 'Smoked Salmon and Spinach Mousse Pate - All Natural,"" being reviewed here, DOES have more ""snob"" appeal, and DOES come with those nice little space-saving black tubs.  But, unlike the Vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread, it has more smoked-salmon taste.  And that, when all is said and done, in the end, the main thing that matters in foods, doesn't it?<br /><br />P.S.  One More Plus:  The ""GourmetFoodStore"" catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food, all by itself.  Did you know HOW MANY types of smoked salmon there are?  HOW many types of caviar?  Whether you buy anything (else) from ""GourmetFoodStore"", this catalogue is not only mouth-watering...but very educational!  Made on fine ""slick"" paper, and filled with beautiful cloured photos, (and also high gourmet-food prices), it is a ""gourmet"" catalogue in more ways than one!  Thanks, GourmetFoodStore!<br /><br />One More Minus:  Sadly, my food came packed in ""peanuts"".  No -- not the edible type of peanuts....the STYROFOAM type of peanuts!  It's impossible to open ANY package packed in styrofoam peanuts, without getting at least some of these innocuous-looking, but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam, all over your floor! GourmetFoodStore is not the only manufacturer/ seller who does this of course....but one would think, with the wonderful, (and espensive) gourmet products they sell, that this up-market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer?  Of course, there IS the TINY advantage in having something packed in peanuts...one gets forced excercise picking up these small, but aggravating, strofoam peace-of-mind-destroyers, off the<br />floor.  OK -- a few calories are used in this way, and, if you are female, you can imagine yourself to be Ruth, (from the Bible), doing some gleaning.  However, I prefer to have MY fantasies when I desire to have them, and to excercise when _I_ decide to excercise, and NOT have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package -- especially from such a luxury-goods emporium as GourmetFoodStore truly is.  Perhaps a $1 charge for having one's goods ""not to be packed in peanuts"" might be applied?  (PLEASE don't make it more than $1!)  Bubble-wrap and similar plastic space-fillers are SO appreciated by customer!  And less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain-relievers....possibly allowing for MORE money to be spent at GourmetFoodStore!  Please consider these ""suggestions for happier custumers"", dear GourmetFoodStore.  Thanks!"
9850,9851,B004NWA9OI,Ginger Beer from Jamaica,"This is what I consider to be true ginger beer.  It tastes like very strong ginger ale.  It has a bite to it.  It is sweetend with refined sugar, not raw sugar, so it doesnt have that strange molases taste."
9851,9852,B001EO7GXA,Not Good,"The mushrooms that were sent were not labeled like the picture, they had the old red and black label. When I opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was discolored so I threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick. There is a date code on the top of the can of 0303 which I have no idea what that means and I can't find any explination of this code online. I will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore. I am a mushroom lover and I have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and I have never had them taste like these did."
9852,9853,B000KJRF40,MMmMM!,I bought a few boxes of these for gifts and opened one up because I couldn't resist.  They're so damn good I ate half the box already.  I'm buying a few more to hand out for christmas!
9877,9878,B001IZEGPQ,What's the deal with the packaging?,"An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more."
9878,9879,B006ZNZH4K,Awesome!,"Fast shipping, items were packaged nicely and are as described. Also, very tasty :) Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy."
9879,9880,B001EO5RMM,Real stevia extract with no additives,"This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal. It's extremely sweet, which means you only have to use a small amount at a time, and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink. Stevia also tastes a little . . . different. (Some describe it as tasting like licorice, but I never thought so). I suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you. Because of stomach problems, this is the only sweetener I use, and I like it very much. I highly recommend it."
9884,9885,B0006PXT6G,Best of the Best,"Only once before have I tasted a better chocolate covered coconut macaroon, and that was long ago and far away.  The dark chocolate is lucious and it's very addicting."
9885,9886,B0011CVG90,great all fruit snack,my 26 month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and I had to overlook the $8.59 for 3 oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for.  the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then Just Tomatoes actual website.  I only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the USA?  I find that a bit hard to believe but I guess everyone has to make a living. some of the fruit is from Vietnam.  The crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack.  the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will establish his appreciation for fruits in their natural state.  the 3oz bag does have a lot in it more then I would have thought before buying.

9892,9893,B000F47E00,"fragrant, delicious, and cheap","Vanilla beans typically run 6-10 dollars for two at major supermarkets. Those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them, and instead I use vanilla bean paste (Williams and Sonoma sells a very good product). But these beans are such a good deal (less than a fifth the supermarket price) that now I'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon. Vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream, a more complex, more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does. These beans arrived fresh, fragrant, and tightly bagged. They're Madagascar vanilla beans, considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to Tahitian beans, but not being one of the cognoscenti, I can't detect much difference at all. This product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping."
9900,9901,B00448RTKS,Cats love it!,My cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors. I dare not run out of these treats or I might have a kitty uprising!

9904,9905,B001CGTN1I,Lowers Blood sugars,"I bought the Navitas Naturals Chia seeds.  They are great.  I put them in a shaker bottle.  I use them on sweet potatoes, in salads and coleslaw and just learned that they can replace half of the fat in baking.  At first I didn't know if it was lowering my blood glucose or if it was something else but I confirmed it the other day.  I had stopped using the seeds and my morning blood glucose shot up to the 140's.  I decided to start using the seeds again and within a few days my blood sugars dropped to the 120's and the only thing I changed in my diet was the addition of chia seeds.  I love them.  I haven't made the gel yet I have only used them raw and they are like eating poppy seeds which I love.  Hope this will help other diabetics.  Navitas is a quality product and is very reasonably priced.  I will definitely continue to buy them."

9980,9981,B0032AM8H8,"Limited Relief, Better Than Nothing","Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea did not cure my heartburn.  In fact, I'm currently 29 weeks' pregnant, and have tried (with my doctor's approval) Tums, Pepcid (famotidine), Papaya Enzymes, pathetically bland food and loads of vanilla ice cream, but nothing has singlehandedly *cured* my heartburn.<br /><br />However, this tea does help, depending on the type and severity of the heartburn.  Marshmallow, the useful ingredient, works by helping to coat your stomach and digestive tract.  When one of my friends recommended this tea to me, she explained, ""It won't stop the acid from being produced, or stop it from coming up, but it will make the whole experience less painful and nasty.""  I couldn't agree more.  Subsequently, it's not as effective for combating the I-shouldn't-have-eaten-that-salsa type of heartburn, but is pretty useful for the 2-am-lying-in-bed-without-gravity-to-help-keep-food-down-it-just-won't-stay-down type of heartburn.  In fact, pair the Earth Mama tea with sleeping in a recliner, and the 2 am burn is no longer one of my concerns.<br /><br />The taste of the tea is sort of grassy with a bit of mint.  I don't find it too bitter to drink without a sweetener.  My best tip for making the tea work well is to start drinking it before the heartburn becomes a problem.  I usually brew a large cup to have with my dinner, then reserve a few mouthfuls' worth of the tea to sip during the night when I wake up.  The taste is fine when the tea is cold, and I find it no less effective.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea."
9984,9985,B004NE2E9O,Wonderful!!,"We first had these sardines in St. Petersburg, Russia and they were the very best sardines I had ever tasted.  I returned home and lo and behold they had the same sardines at our local market.  The next time I looked the didn't carry them anymore.  So I looked online and found them through Amazon at Taylors Market (somehow they can get these sardines at the Finnish store Stockmens in St Petersburg, but we are unable to get them in the United States).  My order will expire on March 27th and I still don't have the sardines, but I reordered today through a different supplier at a much greater cost, but I hope I receive them this time.  They are YUMMY!"
9985,9986,B000P41A28,"Constipation + Sucrose = No, thanks!","You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly, that's not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.<br /><br />Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.<br /><br />Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks!"
10007,10008,B007DJ32XI,No thanks,I have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good.  This is not one of them.  Did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix.

10008,10009,B0048HWXA6,Fun... but gross!,"These jelly beans are great for a party activity (think Harry Potter) or as a gag gift. There are 5-6 different colors of jelly beans. Each color could be one of two flavors, and you won't know which until you bite into it. One flavor is good, like peach, and the other flavor is disgusting, like vomit. Yes, vomit. Some other gross flavors include pencil shavings, skunk smell, rotten eggs (the worst in my opinion) & toothpaste. GREAT party game for kids, my 10 year old & friends loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bad flavors are so gross that no one wants to eat them and they get spit out. So half of the jelly beans go straight into the trash. But I guess it's the novelty that makes it fun!"

10030,10031,B001CGTN1S,#1 superfood,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. My suggestion is to get some Chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."

10360,10361,B000V6FTTU,Good chili,"This chili is filling and mildly spicy. Cooks well, however it makes exploding noises in my microwave."
10375,10376,B0006UE212,Good product,"Works great,I use it for years. Do not use it everyday though,because it is strong.<br />Good to use fiber instead."
10376,10377,B005GGV19C,Great candy... Cheaters box!,"I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (""Movie Size"" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again."
10381,10382,B0001VWGWI,Best chili powder I ever tried!,"I had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place I could find it was amazon.com.  I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!"
10382,10383,B0005XOT8Q,Wheat Nuts from Amazon,Wheat nuts are hard to find in the stores. I was glad to find them on line.  I am very satisfied with the product and  having received them quickly.  Thankyou for such great service.
10384,10385,B000R4FLG2,Very Impressed,"I ordered dried galangal root to make tom kha gai soup.  Although the fresh root tastes better, I ordered the dried root to have ""on hand"".  It does the trick--and the quality is great.<br />TastePadThai shipped my order very fast!  When I opened the box I was surprised to find that they had also included a complimentary assortment of fresh Thai herbs (kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, thai peppers, and galangal).  How generous!  I will definitely shop with TastePadThai again."
10385,10386,B0001UZTJG,Awesomely good stuff!,"Utz Honey Wheat Braided Pretzel Twists are a great snack to keep on hand for a little guilt-free munching. They have a wonderful, mild sweet and salty crunch. With 0g trans fat, no saturated fat and no cholesterol, you'll want to keep them on hand.<br /><br />I absolutely love the packaging. It's very convenient to put out when you have company over, keeps leftovers fresh (Leftovers? What leftovers?), and when you're all done, it's great for storing sewing supplies, little toys, or even a jar to save change for a rainy day!"
10390,10391,B000LRKN1I,Tasty Peach Drink,"The Amita Peach Nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar. So, if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories, you might want to give this drink a try. Also, it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis."
10391,10392,B003LE6PL0,Absolutely Beautiful,I ordered this bouquet for valentine's day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms.  you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in 2-3 days.  I received 14 stargazer lilies and 19 irises.  the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive.  2 packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week (5 days so far).  all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with 1 packet of food.  you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results.
10396,10397,B004O3EGHC,awsome lobster tails,"frozen and fresh on arrival awsome tasting highly recomend this co.,the lobster tails were as advertized jumbo and tasty,some of the best ive ever had"
10397,10398,B00720JZQQ,Delicious!,Omaha Steaks' Franks are really quite delicious but I could not find out what meats are put into them so I only buy them on rare occasions.  Their web site is really geared for pure beef products with no explanations for products of multiple origins.  I know my sister has multiple GI problems but she can eat one of these every once in a while without a stomach upset.  She does complain of the salt content though.  If you don't care how these hotdogs are made then I highly recommend them for great flavor.
10398,10399,B005HI55CS,Super Yummy!!,This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried...and we have tried many! I'm having trouble keeping my husband from over-dosing on the stuff! You can order without worry and be assured of a great product.
10419,10420,B006L22I56,yuck!,"Normally I buy the Fruztio Freeze Dried Apricots made by Crispy Green Co. and they are DELICIOUS- but the store I was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time. So, I decided to try the cantaloupe since I like fresh cantaloupe...how bad could they be?<br />My only choice was a large multi-pack bag, so I forked up the money with high hopes.  I tore into the bag, appreciating the single serve sized bags inside. I opened one up and took a bite. Blech! yuck! These tasted like green, under-ripe canteloupe! I was hoping for that super sweet-I could eat this whole melon- sort of flavor....but no.<br />These were so bad that I threw the whole multi-pack away, and that's saying A LOT, because I'm very frugal with my food purchases. I just knew I would NEVER eat the rest of them. Wish I could give a better review, but i can't.<br />But I do recommend the apricots that I mentioned....they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor!"
10420,10421,B0036FNN7S,Beware of Overpriced Items,"In recent months I have become an Amazon.com Prime Fanatic.  Why? Because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap (meaning ""cost effective"")and have it delivered in two days for free!  How can you hate that?  But, Beware!!<br /><br />As President Reagan once said ""Trust but Verify"". I have actually corrected his intent because I think he was trying to be too Politically Correct; that is ""Distrust and Verify"". You must ALWAYS shop and reshop, internet and retail, to see what makes Price Sense.<br /><br />To the point: I can buy the 40 Oz. (2-1/2 Lb.) bag of B&J Kona Blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for $16.99 (No Sales Tax in MA) at my local BJ's.  An aggressive Amazon.Com Marketplace Seller is offering the same item for $40.69 plus $8.24 shipping, $48.93 Total.  I will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final Unit Price results in.  You be the judge. All I can say again is ""Distrust and Verify"".<br /><br />P.S.  I defend the right of a company to gouge their customers.  That's what Capitalism and America are all about.  Flip side is that others will see the gouging and decide to sell the same product for less money- that's also Capitalism and what we're all about.<br /><br />I would encourage readers to comment on my opinion.  Thank You."
10422,10423,B000LKZL76,This Works! Clears Skin,"I have been drinking this tea for about 2 months now. I have noticed a drastic change in my skin. I normally have really bad skin. I started to drink this for a different reason and then noticed my skin cleared up in the process. I will always drink this now, I've tried so many things for my skin but this beats them all!"
10440,10441,B005LKCWU0,It's so good you'll need to buy extra to sprinkle on the wife!,"Really!<br />This stuff is pure magic for chicken, and pork.<br />I've added it to veggies, FRENCH FRIES OMG!!, beans, you name it.<br />The perfect balance of sweet, salt, and spice."
10444,10445,B000B6MV8M,USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND GLAD AMAZON CARRIES IT,This makes frying chicken easy.  I've used this product for over 20 years but it's not always available locally.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It is also good for making ranch fries.  Just dip the potato wedges in water and coat with this and fry.  Perfect every time.  So is the chicken I make with it.
10445,10446,B000PUTHCM,Best wafers out there,Just put those in the fridge and have them with your coffee - nothing beats that
10446,10447,B000S83R2M,"""This Tea should get the Nobel Peace Prize""","This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
10459,10460,B0034CE9FI,"Delicious, worth the money","I wanted a candy that would last me more than 5 seconds and wouldn't double my weight over the course of eating it. Caramel apple pops fit the bill perfectly: 60 calories, and they last long enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />I went looking for these in local grocery stores and couldn't find them, but luckily Amazon saved the day. The pops came in the packaging that is shown in the picture but (as another reviewer pointed out) they look like they were home made. The pops vary in size, shape and mixture. However, it didn't really bother me and unless you NEED perfectly shaped pops with just the right combination of caramel and hard candy, I doubt it will bother you either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended! Just wish stores would start carrying these again!<br /><br />BTW, here's the nutrition information in case you want it:<br />Calories - 60, Total Fat - 1g, Sodium - 15mg, Total Carbs - 15g, Sugars - 10g, Calcium - 2%"
10463,10464,B0006JKCZ8,Inaccurate Product Description!!!,"I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!"
10464,10465,B007S0JHM2,I believe this is the one i baught.,"it is WONDERFUL, never had a flower yet, i just LOVE the leaves! May 2012 i accidentally dropped it... broke 2 of its good leaves as it hit the floor! BUT it grew right back, this is what makes me so happy, i was so scared it would die on me! But no, this beauty came up with 2 more leaves. LOL!!!!! Love it, just awesome plant, you need fertilizer and good soil for these kinds of plants, it all depends on what you have as a soil/starting stuff..."
10465,10466,B0001FQUFS,Bel Paese Cheese Medallions,"Bel Paese Cheese is an excellent soft Italian cream cheese.  These medallions arrived in excellent condition and were allowed to rest for a day under refrigeration.  The taste, while a bit bland, was very good and was spreadable on water wafer crackers.  The ordering process through Amazon.com was a troubling and difficult to complete, but the shipping was relatively quick.  I would recommend this product."
10467,10468,B000KJF2R2,OK,The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good.
10468,10469,B0016J7SYU,"Love,love,love my nature's path granola!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I am in love with this product!!! Not only me, but also my 18-month old twin boys eat it almost everyday for breakfast. My parents, my niece, my sister and her boyfriend all love it as well.  So, as you can probably tell by now, this is really a delicious cereal. Also, I know that I'm eating something that is good,healthy and organic for me.  Usually I'll eat it with soymilk and some fruit, and it keeps me full and satisfied for a very long time. My household will never run out of it!  I hope that you always keep this product in stock, cause we can't live without it."
10491,10492,B000LRH7HG,Happy Now,"I thought it might not be a great idea to buy meat through the mail but it turned out Great.  I love Gyros and thought why not order from Amazon, at least that would make me feel better about the whole idea.  My order was delivered in 3 days - it would have been 2 but we had a storm and the driver couldn't get here.  It was fabulaously packed with ice packs that we could reuse. The gyros taste great and are pretty conveniet; it makes a great and easy lunch. I will definatly order this again and again."
10501,10502,B001P737PC,Popcorn for the lazy who hate to shop,"Let's face it--if you have no willpower (can't limit yourself to eating 1/3 of a normal-sized bag of microwave popcorn) and HATE to shop at your local store, Prime Eligible ""Point/click to Porch"" doesn't get better, good price.  It's not homemade, but it fills the craving--what more can you ask for that has only 100 calories?"
10513,10514,B001VNHXL4,love it,Perfect bland of spices.  This is a wonderful curry powder and the quanity is generous.  It has lasted me a long time!
10514,10515,B006WAK6QK,Delicious!,"I am not generally a fan of Starbucks regular coffee--or most coffee, for that matter--but this is delicious!  Light and flavorful, not grainy at all.  I only add skim milk and yet it's creamy and sweet.  I wish they made the blonde in decaf, too."
10515,10516,B001BM6Q0Y,"Finally, taste!","I was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago, and one day at my local market happened upon this product.  It was like I finally had stepped back into the world of taste. If you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them.  So now I can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever I like and if I purchase it through amazon by the case, shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market.  Give it a try!"
10528,10529,B000LKXG8W,We love this!,My husband and I love this!  I usually caramelize Walla Walla sweet onions to mix in the cooked product.  We have also added sauteed zucchini and chopped fresh tomatoes.  I do not feel deprived being on a gluten-free diet when I can indulge in this.  (And no it is not mac and cheese - and I don't believe it is meant to be!)
10551,10552,B0000GJFOG,Good Quality,These beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans!
10552,10553,B000F2OJLE,Fantastic!,"This was a great sampler of green coffee to roast.  I haven't tried them all yet, but I liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price!"
10554,10555,B00437FLHS,One of my favorite snacks,I love these snacks!  Great variety of flavors all mixed into one bag.  I also send them to our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and they ship so much better than chips.
10557,10558,B0000DG6XV,"Gluten, Dairy, Corn, Soy Free Bliss!","My son has missed peppermint patties for over a year, these honey mints are FABULOUS and he loves them too.<br />Allergy free goodness!"
10562,10563,B004FDW4HU,Melted Morsels,"Be sure the weather is cooler than 90 degrees when ordering.  I recieved mine right off of the UPS truck after they had been riding around at least half of a day and I recieved 6 bags of  hard melted dark chocolate.  I tried to contact Amazon but was unable to so ended up getting them from ""Family Fun Shoppe"".<br />Several days later I finally reached someone at Amazon and they took the time to straighten things out and refunded my money.  The gentleman I talked to was VERY nice, and the Pieces were/are very tasty !<br /><br />The problem was in the packaging...the second shipment had a small bag of dry ice in it."
10565,10566,B000LL0ZEE,Great Tea!,I absolutely love this tea!  It has a great mild taste to it.  The fact that is decafinated is a great plus!  I highly recommnend this tea!
10566,10567,B000FECGAS,AMAZING!,Just rec'd these yesterday and not only was the shipping super speedy but the candy was extremely fresh! Will order from again without hesitation!
10568,10569,B000PSNJXC,Everything is Rose-y,"This is my first experience with antioxidant-rich white tea.  Also, I like the fair trade and organic labels.  Since I prefer mild teas, the subtle, honey-like sweetness and floral, fruity notes of white rose tea are immediately pleasing.  A stronger brew intensifies the rose flavor, but the tea remains smooth without bitter tannins often found in green and black teas.  The white tea and rose blend is exquisite - a wonderful, soothing treat by itself or with dessert.<br /><br />This has become my favorite tea!"
10572,10573,B000JMDHEA,Amul ghee,Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container.
10576,10577,B0009JHVN6,Absolutely Perfect - Just don't heat at too high a temperature,"I bought Fireworks Wisconsin white birch popcorn 64oz seeking the perfect popcorn for my Whirleypop popper, but I wrecked the batches simply by cooking them too hot. Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.<br /><br />  If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:<br />- Add 2-3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;<br />- On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)<br />- When the 3 kernels pop, add 1/3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)<br />- Meanwhile, melt 1/4 to 1/3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.<br />- When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating / or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.<br /><br />  The very best you've ever had . . . true?<br /><br />Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister. It stays genuinely fresh throughout the week.<br /><br />  P.S. I'm just a happy customer. I don't sell popcorn. (But now I eat too much of it.)"
10578,10579,B003OB4B2U,"Not quite lime, more lemon grassy...","And that's not a detraction!  I love lemon grass tea!  I love this soup!  Going to double my order on the next one I make, this one is so good.  It's the only one I've ever found that I made a second when I finished the first.  I'm thinking stirfry some chicken breast, add a handful of slivered veggies, and make this one a real meal!"
10583,10584,B0052BRWIU,Okay,"I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because they're basically middle-of-the-road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you won't miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.<br /><br />These cookies are great if you're on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.<br /><br />I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand."
10587,10588,B0018CJMIA,My Dog Loves this Food!,We've used this food for over 4 years and my dog loves it. It's healthy and keeps her coat shiny and her belly full!
10588,10589,B0009K79UK,Good with lots of milk,"I buy this coffee from a Japanese grocery store. (Though I would happily buy it from Amazon if the price were similar.) I prepare it by heating a mug of equal quantities of milk and water in the microwave, then adding a tablespoon of this coffee and some sugar. I imagine, like all instant coffee, it would taste pretty nasty without the milk, but with milk it actually is good. This is the fastest way to obtain a cup of tolerable coffee that I know of, short of buying it already made."
10589,10590,B004ILTCSS,Ginger Extract,"It's all it's cracked up to be. I will be ordering more when I run out. The product came in the mail, on time, and in good condition."
10590,10591,B001EO6A00,NOW foods organic quinoa is great,"I had been looking for an affordable priced quinoa since it is pretty expensive in my store. I noticed Amamzon.com had a sale on quinoa and took a chance on buying it since we had never tried it before. The NOW brand of quinoa is organic which is a HUGE plus. The grains are pretty clean already but I still rinse before using. The qunioa is great, so very healthy and cooks in around 20 minutes (even though the pacakge states 15 minutes). I will be definitly be buying this brand again from Amazon.com as it arrived in excellent condition within 5 days.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying/buying quinoa, I highly recommend the NOW organic quinoa."
10595,10596,B0000YQ050,Some of the best mix for Frappes.,Our local coffee shop uses this mix and it's great. I have been thinking about buying some for home but I was wondering if someone could post the nutritional information for me.<br /><br />Thanks!
10597,10598,B004FCGIJ6,DELICIOUS-ALL NATURAL COOKIES,I ordered Soozies Doozies Soft&Rich Cookie Gift Tin for my daughter for Easter.<br />She loved them because they were FRESH and made with ALL NATURAL INGRIDIENTS.<br />I would purchase them again.
10598,10599,B000G1769G,A hearty delicious soup,"I love Amy's because you can actually pronounce all the ingredients she uses--no chemicals, no preservatives, nothing you need a chemistry degree to decipher--and she makes pretty tasty food.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of canned soups, but the Alphabet Soup is an exception.  It's a rich tomatoey broth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets.  I like soup without a lot of ""clutter,"" so to speak.  My sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy, but then what do you expect in a canned soup?  Still, if you're looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day, Amy's Fat Free Alphabet Soup fits the bill."
10605,10606,B0079YAR3U,What's with the price??,"I like this coffee, but $37 for two 12-ounce bags? I can get it online from Walmart or even from my local grocery store for $7-9 per 12-ounce bag. Geez."
10606,10607,B0018CJMI0,Loves it,My papillon has been eating this for a while and loves it.  It was easy switching from his previous dog food (purina of some sort) and he took to it right away.
10607,10608,B004U8VU4S,Real Peanuts!,"I'm a fan of Virginia peanuts, and Virginia Diner does some of the best.  These are peanuts that haven't been fancied up -- not very salty, no artificial flavors, and no oily feel to them.  You get that wonderful, pure peanut taste.  Another plus?  They're BIG."
10608,10609,B002DHN956,"Item Good...Description and Price, Not So Good","I absolutely LOVE Kashi granola bars!!  Especially these Honey Almond Fax and the Trail Mix variety, but I won't be buying them from this seller.  As you can see on the box shown, these are actually in a SIX pack not a 12-pack as the description states.  So that comes out to 36 bars...for $45??  WHOA! $7.50 a box...I don't think so!!  So, while I would definitely recommend these bars as seriously good food that is good for you (fyi, read the ingredients list...all pronounceable and healthy!)I would not recommend buying them from this seller.  Many of the club stores get them, at least occasionally, and you can get a good deal."
10617,10618,B001EPQ9Y6,La Piana tarallini,"I found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste. My previous experience with tarallini was different, they were crunchier and not crumbly. Whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe, I don't know, but I would not buy this product again."
10618,10619,B0002IZCZS,Like this soba,"I wasn't a soba fan before, but when I tried this I became a fan! Just cook for 5 minutes and drain, served either cold or hot, good with just simplest soba soy sauce!"
10619,10620,B004GU3YXU,There are still shells/husks in the bag,"I bought these based on another review from the other product, the Nutiva hempseeds 3 pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not.  I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds, sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  I'll upload a picture when I get the chance, it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth, it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch, who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers, just telling my story on my purchase.  I'm going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet."
10637,10638,B001QV7OQ0,"great taste, but hard to open","these are great tasting candies for a sugar-free variety, but they get sticky and very hard to take out of the individual wrappers, especially without getting the candy all over your fingers."
10638,10639,B001BKNB04,Meow Mix has nothing on this shiz.,"I can't sleep past 6 AM anymore because of this food.  One of my cats sits on my face, attempting to suffocate me into consciousness (cats aren't very good at biology..), while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of ""love"" until I get up.  If I stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, I'm treated to a rousing refrain of ""MROW MROW SCRATCH YOWL"" outside of the door--and that's if they don't follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they're caught in my gravitational pull, all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else.<br /><br />The only cons, really.  And they're cute cons, so I let it slide.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, my cats love this stuff.  They eat it, rocket around the house for 45 minutes like they've just done some meth (oh, the power of organic ingredients!), then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until I get home from work.<br /><br />Cat win?  I think so."
10642,10643,B006BXUX1Q,Surprisingly Good if Still Keebler Level,"I generally consider Keebler products to be definitely designed for children, and not appealing to adult sensibilities.  I bought these on chance because I love mint flavored products and they were on sale.  I fully expected to find them gagging and that I would have to give them away.<br /><br />Surprisingly they aren't bad.  I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.  Each bar is individually wrapped, which I thought was overkill for a box of cookies, but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse.  Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.<br /><br />I'm not sure if these are designed for children or adults.  They seem much too large to be meant for children, and I'm not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration."
10643,10644,B0041HVM9Q,One of my favorite gluten free cookies,Delicious! So glad I found these cookies!! Softer than your average gluten free cookie with no after taste. They can be addicting!!
10644,10645,B001KVNDM0,Almonds,"Blue Diamond Almonds, Whole Natural, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24); I buy these nuts every time Amazon has them. They are very good for you and much less expensive then the grocery store when you figure per bag price I pay $.89 here.  I have a heart condition and need all the good protein I can get. These are a good source for this. It is only natural fat and no added salt. I wish I could get them even at a bigger savings with the 15% savings by ""Subscribe and Save"".<br /><br />My husband carries these in his pocket as a mid-day snack and I have my daily dose that my MD orders. They taste very good once you get used to eating no salt or added oils.<br /><br />I highly recommend. I hope this helps."
10651,10652,B005DVVAH8,So Freaking Good!,"Whom ever came up with the idea to dip pretzels in yogurt, was either high, a genious, or the devil himself..probably all.<br /><br />Point is, these things are so freaking good! The right amount of salt and sweet on each pretzel, it's hard to stop eating them, so a word of caution, for every 8 pretzels you eat, you get 11gm of sugar, and so people trying to lose weight or in any sort of special diet, should pay extra attention when or before eating these.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing negative to say about this product. The bags (6 of them) came well packaged and the pretzels taste fresh. I can't really give this product a low score due to its sugar content, etc., because I knew what I was buying and expected it to be this way. Hope this helps."
10655,10656,B0006L0UBC,Canine Testimonial,All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us.
10657,10658,B000BQUUTO,Black ants don't even get close to it,"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection)."
10659,10660,B000FABKWW,Knorr Soups and Mixes Are The Best - And So Is Amazon's Price,"I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.<br /><br />I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket."
10660,10661,B004AE1FGK,A Little Disappointed,"The Grape Jam, itself, is of the highest quality, and it tastes great, so I have absolutely no complaints there. However, the glass jars were poorly packaged (it was very heavy and fragile, and was insulated with just two small pillow puffs), and two of the twelve jars arrived with the seals already broken. Since I could not be sure if the food was safe to eat, I had to throw away the two jars. I would not order this product again(or anything else that comes in jars) for that reason."
10661,10662,B004G90KE2,Awful.  How can they sell this in good conscience?,"This tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade; it was totally dried out when I opened it.  When treacle sponge pudding dries, it smells nasty and can't be reconstituted, even with water and some heat.<br /><br />Total waste of money."
10662,10663,B00727IF06,My favorite chip,"These are, hands-down, my favorite potato chips.  They are very light and flaky with a hint of vinegar that make them simply irresistible."
10663,10664,B0019LXINU,organic smooth move,I like this product because it is a very fast working product.  It works every time and you know what to expect. No unexpected emergencies.  Very smooth!!
10665,10666,B000J3K4ZE,Fantastic Rub - nothing better in the market,"Ok Folks - listen up. For special occasions, we'll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb.  You're lucky today if you can even find it in the stores - it's so expensive - often at $20-40 per pound.  So, the very last thing you want to do, after spending all that money, is ruin it with the wrong flavoring. Colorado Spices, New Zealand Lamb Rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat.  We just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was FANTASTIC. My 88 year old Mother, who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan (she's used to plain, New England cooking) loves and uses the rub on chicken, lamb, and fish.  She's having me order another case and loves the individual packets - as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh.  This is a great product!"
10666,10667,B00389Q4XW,Average,"Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping."
10721,10722,B000NMG99Q,Just like from when I was a kid...,"I remember going with my mother to Payless drug store, which has turned into CVS Pharmacy here on the West Coast.  Payless used to sell these in the 80s and while the packaging is different now, the candy is still the same.  Boy are these good.  My mom got me hooked on them, and on the Milk and Honey ones too, and I just love them now just as much as when I was 10!  I am so glad to find these, the honey inside is very good, and the outside tastes like lovely solid honey.  I love ordering this larger pack since I can just grab a bar and tuck it into my purse and and eat these as a light snack or to freshen my breath.  If you love putting honey on toast, or just eating it out of the jar, you will probably like these.  The honey inside is a light honey, not dark just in case that matters to you."
10731,10732,B000UCW7D6,"Very good rub, but don't buy it at $25!","All Tom Douglas rubs are great, but I have no idea why they're listed for $25+ here. You can buy them for about $6 in Seattle grocery stores or at Tom Douglas' website."
10732,10733,B001KUSJ7U,The best cereal we every had!  Please keep up the good work.,This cereal is awesome and our very favorite of all of the Nature's Path Cereals.  We love it and buy it in multiple boxes!
10734,10735,B000LR4FA8,Excellent Quality and Value,"I really enjoyed this product. It tastes good and is very close to the Russian or Iranian versions. Also, the service and quick delivery were an added bonus.  I would highly recommend this product."
10736,10737,B0075YGV9I,So nice to get a piece of home,Received this item as expected - if anyone has had peanut porridge - this is  as close as it gets to Jamaica !
10737,10738,B003OEVLYS,Good Deal!,"Good deal, better than buying at the local craft store and even better than the online cake supply stores.  Item arrived as promised and will be useful when making Spider and Turkey cupckaes during the fall baking season."
10738,10739,B0029NVMXA,Sliced Hard Chicken Hot Dogs for Cats!,"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
10755,10756,B008VRDF42,Bought for my wonderful mother,"My mom had gotten some of the dollar store knockoffs - they weren't bad and they certainly were cheap, but the look on her face when I gave her these was worth every penny.<br /><br />Although, I think she's managed to eat most of them in a couple of weeks and still stays 120 lbs... LOL"
10757,10758,B0001FQUF8,Fantastic cheese,Great cheese. Wonderful flavor. Made my spaghetti & meatballs better than it's ever been & made the lasagna even better. Fast delivery.
10758,10759,B001EQ5536,Adds a great punch of flavor!,"I use this low-sodium seasoning blend all of the time. I just add it to a dish at the end of preparation for a punch of flavor. The roasted garlic is milder than fresh, so you don't have to worry about the usual raw garlic flavor, which makes it perfect to sprinkle over soups, salads, baked potatoes, dips, etc. It has it onion, red and green peppers, and additional ingredients in it.<br /><br />5/6/12 Still an excellent product, but not worth the new price. I will not be reordering."
10766,10767,B003UMZ1ZY,Great things comes in small packages,This was the first time I had quail. It was done for passover.The quail was a great addition the to lamb .
10767,10768,B003QBCUR6,great cup of coffee,"I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual Starbucks VIA decaf Italian Roast coffee drinker. Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our ""local"" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf. It seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant."
10782,10783,B004M71GPU,"To each their own, but my favorite!","Despite the other review, this is the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  It's a mustard based sauce, so if that's not your thing, move on.  It's not really that spicy (used to be called Habanero sauce), in fact, that would be my only complaint.  As much I love shopping Amazon, buy this direct from their website if you're going to order 6 bottles or more, it's cheaper ($55/12).  It's great on pulled pork and burgers.  Try it!"
10784,10785,B001VIY9KW,has corn in it,"We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking."
10791,10792,B001GM969M,A wonderful product.,"Like another reviewer here, I use this granulated honey for my tea and I use it for my coffee.  It is oh so much better than white sugar.  I had been in the habit of using the unprocessed sugar, which was good, but this is so much better.<br /><br />This product does indeed give backed goods a bit of a different, in a positive way, flavor and I use it with cookies.  I buy my granulate honey at a local health food shop and the price here, even if you consider the shipping, is quite competitive.  The other advantage is that this stuff is becoming more and more popular in my area and our local shops are forever running out of it.  It is nice to know I have a reliable source.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product."
10803,10804,B001SAOL8S,HORRAY FOR PEPPERS,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. USE IT IN EGGS, MEATLOAF, SPAGHETTI SAUCE, EVERYTHNG. I'VE EATEN THEM OUT OF THE JAR.:o)))"
10806,10807,B001E4Q5WI,A Family Favorite,"Although I'm a little embarrassed touting something so processed (maybe it's a reaction to a childhood eating peanut butter my parents hand-ground at their local health food store) I have to say I really like this stuff.  It is also the only peanut butter my 10 year old daughter will eat (can't get any other brands past her).  The reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste, and for some reason only the Skippy brand maintains its smooth texture--every other brand I've tried gets tough or grainy patches in it.  This product is getting harder to find in supermarkets (and when I do find it it's at a premium price), so the availability on Amazon is great."
10822,10823,B000XSJLWM,Favorite oatmeal!,"This oatmeal is extremely filling and has a hearty consistency, impressive for an instant oatmeal, I know.<br /><br />The flavor is somewhat bland, which allows one to be creative with add-ins! (I prefer to add raisins, dried cranberries, and/or cinnamon to mine).<br /><br />The nutritional information is great, especially the plant derived Omega and added whole flax seeds, but I wish there was less added sugar in it though.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy this is my breakfast every morning, as I get myself off to a healthy start each day!"
10829,10830,B0034KP00S,Great Breakfast flavor!,"So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that ""Almond"" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to ""Buttery French Toast"", as this would be much better fitting."
10891,10892,B004FRT992,Best so far,"So far this is the best cola flavoring I've found for those wanting to make their own cola.  It's got stevia in it, so it still doesn't taste 100% like coca cola, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes.  And hey - no artificial sweeteners is always good!<br /><br />It doesn't taste quite like cola, but it's close enough to make me happy and I liek it for it's own flavor."
10894,10895,B0071H5WKS,A great taste of home!,"I'm sitting here watching the Olympics, enjoying my latte. And in the national spirit of giving praise, this espresso ground is great! We moved from California and have been dissapointed with the affordable coffee here in NYC. I missed my Peet's!!They're tops in flavor and body. It's just a godsend to have it arrive fresh and ready to go. Thanks!"
10895,10896,B00270Z6FA,item is delicious; price is ridiculous,"During my recent visit to New Orleans in June of 2012, I fell in love with Etouffee' sauce on redfish.  Oh my goodness. Delicious.  I picked up a few packages of the Louisiana Cajun Etouffee Mix, for $2.00 per package, and made it at home. It was fantastic.  I ordered the product on Amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars, was delivered one package. The product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount...I assumed three packages for that price. I received one package and returned it to them immediately.  You can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping.  So, avoid purchasing this via this seller.  Great product however."
10897,10898,B0011UZCI8,Delicious,"Delicious!<br />Ideal to eat with fruit, and if you want to eat with some chips (is not too spicy) i like this very much"
10898,10899,B000EM6PC6,Works great with a Keurig Brewer !!!,I really love my Keurig brewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee K-cups I knew I needed a more cost efficient solution. I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.
10954,10955,B004UZWHPC,Herbal Tea: 5 Fruit Flavors,"Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas."
10955,10956,B002MXSKVE,Lovely spicy Chai Tea,"I love this tea served as Chai latte, served with milk and honey. In fact, I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it gives it a lovely creamy taste. I am no expert on Chai Tea but then, I go by what I like, and I find this particular blend very pleasing. I would recommend it to anyone who like spicy teas."
10956,10957,B0083WY8KU,Best Thai Tea so far,"So far this is the closest thing to the Thai restaurant I've tried.  And though it's close, it's still not exactly the same.  It does have that one spice that other Thai teas are missing. It's really outstanding."
10957,10958,B000LT0TOW,unbelievably delicious,These truffles melt slowly in your mouth with a wonderful flavor and smoothness. And you want just one! The most satisfying chocolate I've ever had.  I want some NOW!
10958,10959,B001BIXK7K,Serious Stuff,"If you are looking for a way to get someone that thinks they can eat anything hot this is it.  I purchased Kick Your Ass sauce which was rated 1,000,000 sc.  Put a bunch on a chip and eat it.  Nothing.  No reaction.  The next day Da'Bomb showed up at my door.  Thinking that it's not much worse than the other I put a bunch on a  chip.....Wow pain.  No Joke pain.  Instantly. The first thing in my mind was why did I do that $%^&*(.  This product is something that you can add to a soup or something but don't put anymore than a drop in your mouth at a time.  It is a neat experience to put a drop in your mouth, serious pain for about 30 minutes but any more rips your insides.  This even from a person that heats habaneros by themselves with his food.<br /><br />If you are going to play a joke on someone, just a drop is good.  The braveheart yesterday had to leave work and didn't return to normal for about 5 hours.  I told him only a drop. His quoto is below when I told him what some other people's reactions were when they took a drop.<br /><br />""Tell them my insides are STILL on fuego. I tried on 3 occasions to puke it all up and nothing. I was sitting on the can and decided I'd better pull up my pants in case I passed out on the bathroom floor-that way the person that found me wouldn't have to see me with my pants around my ankles. I took a piss and it felt like razor blades were coming out. I hope you're happy!!""<br /><br />Trust me some fun stuff and the price is much better than the other stuff that pushes the limit."
10989,10990,B00012UXEA,Great gift ideas at Christmas,The dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for Christmas<br />The tin was something you dont see in America anymore.<br />Perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas.
10992,10993,B004N71J7O,Great coffee,"A friend introduced me to Lavazza a few years ago, and I have to say it's one of the nicest coffees I've had. I use it in my stove top espresso maker, and it brews a perfect cup every time. I also use the decaf version, which is also really good for decaf. My only gripe would be that it's neither fair trade or organic."
10995,10996,B001NJI7GQ,Ambrosia.,"My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!"
11039,11040,B0022MH2QE,These are great.,My 26 year old horse Little Joe loves these and they are helping him. I wish they come in bigger bags.
11042,11043,B000BWUFEI,Christmas treat,"I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark."
11043,11044,B0000VYKXC,Very interesting blend,"I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it."
11051,11052,B002RU3UNK,Different packaging but that's okay,"The product I received came in a different package than what is pictured but that is fine because it was a little bigger than what I expected. The oil doesnt really have a smell so that is good because I intend to use it in a mixture of oils for my natural hair. The delivery was fast and even arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date. I've only used it once so far and mixed it 50/50 with Olive Oil as a hot oil treatment, it wasn't greasy at all and left my hair nice and soft. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had time to use it enough. I will update this review after I have used it for awhile and can make a better assessment."
11053,11054,B003SSBY60,Tasteless,Do not order this! It has absolutely no taste and was COMPLETELY disappointing!I tried to return the unopened 5 boxes and Amazon would not let me...total bummer and waste of money.
11054,11055,B003M8GSWQ,Dogs Love Them,"These inexpensive little rewards for dogs seem to be a good quality and very palatable.<br /><br />I've had problems pleasing my dogs as far as tasty treats, some snacks are just completely ignored.<br /><br />I've had no problem with my dog accepting these snacks and actually they consume it eagerly and quick, so it passes the taste test.<br /><br />Sergean't's is an established and trusted name in pet care products and this is a fine product your dog will probably love."
11056,11057,B0009RWJRQ,YUM,"For those of you that have never tried spiedies (which is most anyone that is NOT from the Endicott, NY area), you should do yourself a favor and use Salamida's Spiedie Marinade.  Cut up some chicken into chunks, marinade for 48 hours and bbq on skewers...serve on italian bread or rolls...YUM.  So nice to be able to get this sauce shipped to the house in California!"
11057,11058,B000OV5NB6,Super good,"I love this stuff. It's not your regular milk chocolate hot cocoa, but if you like trying different flavors of cocoa, you should give this a try.  To me it tastes like dark chocolate and isn't as sweet as the regular stuff. But it has a great taste and it's actually good for you. Highly recomend it."
11059,11060,B001FSK3I0,go to Amazon when you can't find in locally,"I was so frustrated - they hooked me on this product at the local Walmart and then stopped carrying it.  I could not find it at any of the local stores, so I went to Amazon - and there it was!  I have enough to last for a good while now and it was exactly as advertised and arrived in good time."
11067,11068,B004INIUQQ,Great!,"My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food, though. I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time..."
11070,11071,B002TSHYSW,Fantastic gourmet chip - this flavor is one of the best.,"I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review."
11113,11114,B000Y2OP0K,Nice and Waxy,"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker"
11116,11117,B004XCG74Y,Wonderful Coffee,This was great coffee and I would order this again! My husband loves this particular one because it is mild and has a great flavor as well.
11117,11118,B002G8HLM4,Passable!,"This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon."
11118,11119,B004BZU2LM,Seems expensive,These are great treats - in fact they are the only thing I use for my dog.  But this price seem way wrong - so far off as to possibly be incorrect??  In my local PetSmart they are $5.99.
11119,11120,B000IKEE9K,Satisfied.,"I saw the price on Amazon, and I jumped at it!  It was a great deal compared to others that I found on the Internet.  Bought the box of Jelly Belly Tangerine Jelly Beans as wedding favors.  Great Steal!"
11120,11121,B0057QMXRK,Gets the job done,"My fiance' loves fortune cookies so I figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question. Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word ""Will"" through the backside of the cookie.<br /><br />Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.<br /><br />And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what you're getting.<br /><br />Buy only out of desperation."
11121,11122,B007IK5QZO,Really is Extra Virgin Olive Oil,"I bought this olive oil because of the testing done by University California Davis in early 2010.  The results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples, and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples.  It seems to be more potent (because it's spicier) than the, Trader Joe's organic brand which cost 40% less.  You do know that about 80% of all extra virgin olive oil products are not 100% extra virgin olive oil.  Five stars because it's a decent price and I trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands.<br />This oil is from Italy, which means this oil is milled in October or November or December, as with all northern hemisphere olive oils.  The southern hemisphere olive oils are milled in June and July."
11131,11132,B0013TKTB2,Good but a little weak,Coffee has good flavor but I find it to be a little on the weak side. So I use more than one bag per pot and thus removes the convenience of using bags in the first place.
11132,11133,B00213ERI0,"These are good.  Very, very good.","I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me."

11247,11248,B0007ZKS00,The Only Thing Better Than . . .,"Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the ""blum"" in Jablum)!"
11258,11259,B000VZSO2U,English Strawberry Jam,ITS HUGE...3 Kilos...taste is not a great as I remember but still good. more strawberry taste than a lot of American jams. I would buy again in other flavors too. Great for large families.

11266,11267,B001SAW31U,"Not bad for ""sardines in bulk"".","Hint, pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up.<br /><br />I just tried a can of these for breakfast this morning.  There were about 9.5 ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce.  Still not bad considering that's the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them 24 at a time.<br /><br />The fish weren't the freshest tasting I've had, but they weren't that bad either.  At least they're the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans.<br /><br />Here's way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium."
11267,11268,B0056CSBO4,Almost no detectable flavor,"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again."
11269,11270,B001AY8FUM,Great Stuff!!,"I used to use another product by another vendor but they were always running out and not replacing their product for quite a while.  I was glad I found this product as it is even better than the one I used to use.  I LOVE IT!!!!  As a Hawaiian, I eat rice every day and I always sprinkle the Nori Komi on my hot steamed rice....mmmmmm..making me hungry!  I highly recommend this product.  Also, I received this product quickly and it was packed very well."
11271,11272,B000E21Z7Q,Protein in a snack means Gastric Bypass patients can enjoy with everyone else,"After gastric bypass surgery, you have to eat 50 or more grams of protein EVERY DAY. Sugar-free Protein shakes give you most of it. But you do like to get it from other sources also. You have a very small 1/8-1/4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value. Also, you can't eat sugar., but you can eat sugar substitutes. So KAY'S NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE GREAT! They have tons of protein and they taste great! These cinnamon toast pretzel sticks are great...the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it--because there isn't much of it. The white cheddar kruncheeze snacks are great also...they are like cheetos and you like to be able to have a snack when other people do. Also, the Thank you KAYS! You help us take casre of ourselves while we ENJOY food and make eating a little more normal. Lisa"

11299,11300,B002K660K6,Perfect for wedding favors and gorgeous color!,I purchased these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit! The candied almonds were not too sweet and the mint green color is gorgeous. It was a whole lot cheaper to buy these on Amazon.
11301,11302,B000N648OA,DELIGHFUL SAYS THE GROUP,"I have 5 cats, of whom 4 live inside and 1 is outside. It is quite difficult to find one food that appeals to this myriad of tastes. Seems like someone has a ""no thank you,"" ""are you kidding me"", ""not on your life'"" or a plain ""yeech!"" on any choice i see that looks just delightful.But no, I am the human Momcat and my tastes are just not the same of those as the princes and princesses in my care.<br /><br />But Merrick Grammys Pot Pie Cat Food has hit the rare airy quality of being one of the few foods that is eaten by everyone, all the time, each time it is served. That is a heady rating. There are only a couple of other foods which have reached that level at our house. One is the White Meat and Chicken by Pro Plan.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODAS9M"">Pro Plan White Meat Chicken & Vegetable Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> The second is Salmon and Chicken by Tiki<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN8JDK"">Tiki Cat Consomme, 8-Pack, 6-Ounce Can, Napili Luau Wild Salmon and Chicken in Chicken</a>The Third is Tilapia by Fancy Feast.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So of all the cat foods I buy, only four are always eaten, by everyone, all the time and Grammys pot pie is one of them. SO the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by Merrick. I will try, for their sake...for them anything...but I doubt a raging success. Some things always look great at the start, but then do not make it to the ""all the time, every time, every one"" category.<br /><br />But, my guys give this 5 stars and say ""thank you"" for reading what we think: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. It is a 5 star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also, so give it a try...""you know, for their sake, or however she says that."" ""We agree on this Merrick!!!"""

11307,11308,B0041QD39O,Try it once...,"I admit I'm a coffee snob. It's my one vice. I fell in love with coffee when I went to Venice. I found a little coffee shop on the Grand Canal. I knew that moment with its aromas and sights would be locked into my spirit as a rite of passage in a sense. Unfortunately back in the states I discovered another world. Most of the coffees here tasted like something that was scraped off the pavement at Jiffy Lube. Eventually, after much research I found a couple of great brands, bought my own espresso machine and we lived happily ever after.<br /><br />One day I read an article on Weaver's. It sounded good. Since I'm a happy member of Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a try. It is amazing. Even the subtle caramel flavor and scent is rich and soothing. It's like finding a new close friend to share those moments in the sun with.<br /><br />Let's face it: good coffee is like a good friend, but great coffee is like a soul mate. This is that coffee."
11343,11344,B001I4H6H2,Buy this somewhere else. Not from anneeavon!!!,"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products."

11346,11347,B000N62EKK,Amazon Regular,"My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  You'd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time."

11362,11363,B003HI2ZFU,Fake Colored Crystals!,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."

11370,11371,B001KPK4XM,Mmm... Banana!,"While they aren't my favorite fruits, I do enjoy bananas and I keep them on hand because I love to add them to my smoothies (I usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of Matcha to all my smoothies too).<br /><br />This matcha has a delicious banana-y flavor that isn't too sweet.  The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.  The lovely, creamy, buttery tones are still there, and it still tastes like Matcha... but it's not veggie or grassy tasting like some Matcha can taste.<br /><br />I like!"

Not to take anything away from the other guys, they roast some wonderful coffee too, but Larry's Beans is the master of blending beans from different regions to come up with very drinkable, delicious coffee.  Wjat sets Larry's Beans apart is that they are consistently less expensive than the other guys mentioned.  For this reason, Larry' Beans gets most of my business."

11375,11376,B004CPAPBS,"Good prunes, but what's with the price here? Error?","I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least."

11377,11378,B0007MXSV4,Some say this is THE BEST hot sauce!,"This line of hot sauces was found on every table, during our trip to Belize, and I have looked at every supermarket I visit at home for Marie Sharp's brand, to no avail. Finally, found it on Amazon and ordered 4 different types. They came well packaged, in a timely fashion and those in my household who use hot sauce at almost every meal are thrilled! We live in an area with lots of Hispanic markets and a sea of spicy sauces and foods available, but not Marie Sharp's. It's wonderful: ""heat with a little sweet"". Made in and exported by the tiny country of Belize, I recommend you give it a try. Amazon usually has special deals when ordering several bottles at a time."

11380,11381,B004I5H8C6,Enjoyable,"This tea is a nice change from my regular black tea. I'm not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice. It's closer to black but has it's own special taste, which I found myself looking forward to. Great in the evening as it doesn't contain caffeine."
11382,11383,B001RRPJVA,Too expensive!,These are tasty enough for an emergency snack/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijer's sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that.
11386,11387,B006ZOUDNO,Too Expensive!,"We love Trader Joe's Just the Clusters Vanilla Almond Granola Cereal but were very disappointed with the quantity we recived for the price charged.  As a result, we returned same."
11387,11388,B0002NVKWW,Knock your socks off,"Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were.  Unbelievably beautiful, deeply fragrant, terrific huge intact slices.  Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category.  Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak.  Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini, some stock and a shot of marsala.  To top it all: the price is reasonable.  Bravo!"
11397,11398,B0038ACQO2,Amazing soft pretzels!,One of my most favorite things to eat is a soft pretzel. I enjoy going to the movies just so I can eat a soft pretzel! These soft pretzels are awesome! I will definitely order more in the future.

11402,11403,B0043CA9RA,Very Delicious,I enjoy the flavor of this very delicious soft peach candy.  It has definitely become one of my all time favorite candies.  The other flavors that this seller makes are also good but the peach flavor ranks #1 in my book.
11404,11405,B0040PYN86,Good fruit,"Not Blenheims (the gold standard in apricots :) but I have had far worse than these. The fruits are pleasantly tart sweet and have good nutritional value (vitamin A) compared to canned peaches (which are still a favorite). One or two cans were delivered with a small dent but the apricots themselves are unblemished. I am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but I can honestly say that mine were not salty. And the can indicates that no salt has been added. Perhaps it was the potassium in the skins but I think they help intensify the apricot flavors of the pear juice. In short, these are all ""natural"" i.e. no added sugar or corn syrup which is a plus for me. A good item to have on hand for quick healthy desserts either plain or with a sprinkling of granola and a scoop of a fav sorbet/sherbet/ice cream."
11410,11411,B00017WSKW,also know as black mustard,this mustard is called brown but it is identical to what other company's label as black.  good quality delivered in small bags.
11411,11412,B000WL167S,Great breath enhancer.,I can no longer buy this in my area so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is one of my favorite breath mints which I keep in various places around my home as well as in both of my cars.
11412,11413,B003FDFTEG,Inferior,"Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone."
11413,11414,B0040U9KS4,Love this gum.,Very good gum - flavor doesn't last a long time but I still love it.  The peppermint is my favorite.
11414,11415,B00081KYPW,2% CAFFEINE IS NOT DECAFF!,"In order for tea to be labeled ""decaff"" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf."
11415,11416,B00025691M,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."
11416,11417,B0002NVKWC,Knock your socks off,"Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were.  Unbelievably beautiful, deeply fragrant, terrific huge intact slices.  Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category.  Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak.  Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini, some stock and a shot of marsala.  To top it all: the price is reasonable.  Bravo!"
11426,11427,B000QGGIYK,Misleading,"Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast."
11427,11428,B005GIF7N6,not the best,These are from China and nowhere as good as those from Italy. Spend the extra money and get those from Italy.
11429,11430,B002KB9CQK,"Pretty good, but...","Excellent size and not too many are broken, but they may be RAW, not ROASTED, so beware. Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.<br /><br />I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the ""run around"" game, so BEWARE."
11432,11433,B004AJIGDK,The BEST for muffins!,"This cake mix can not be beat for making muffins. I have purchased this locally for years and the resturant supply who carried it discontinued it. I tried several different recipes and cake mixes, nothing compared to Ghiradelli! So glad I can still get it online ar Amazon. Wonderful stuff!"
11434,11435,B001IW05RM,"Jolt Blue again, at long last!","While the flavor of Jolt Blue has changed due to the change to corn syrup from sugar back in the day, it's still pretty much the same thing that it always was.  It's still tasty (and where else are you going to get blue raspberry soda?) and it still packs the same caffeine punch that it always did.  Tasty, and in the classic bottles -- what more could I ask for?"
11436,11437,B002Y71D2Q,Just ok in flavor,Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didn't find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor.
11437,11438,B0001JXE6M,Excellent,"Great product, exactly as expected.  Actually arrived in plastic containers, not the bags as shown - a definite and appreciated upgrade."
11439,11440,B0001U4VK4,Yum Yum !,"Fresh in the barrel and that's the way they stay. The screw top lid keeps them as fresh as the day they arrived. A very hearty pretzle. Not as thin as pretzel sticks, but not as thick as a pretzel rod. Just the right in between. Fresh tasting and not too much salt.<br /><br />Unless you are having a party, one barrel will go a long way. I bought two barrels to save 10% and ended up sending one baarrel to my company's office. Really a lot of pretzels for the money. Will buy them again."
11444,11445,B0015D43NQ,MMMMM,"My absolute favorite. Very cherry indeed. This is the only jelly bean I enjoy. Guess I will have to order more. Thay lasted no time with the grandkids, lol"
11445,11446,B001EQ4G54,Awesome!,"I love mexican food,  and taco kits.  Taco Bell brand soft tacos is one of my favorite ones if not my favorite taco kit!  You may not exactly save when subscribing.  I usually buy these when they are on sale for 1.99 but you do get them quick and easy every month.<br />The kit comes with soft tortilla taco shells,  the seasoning mix,  and taco sauce.<br />I want to buy a little container of extra seasoning because sometimes i use too much meat or my meat seems like it can use a little more flavoring.  Especially when using turkey.<br />Otherwise I love this kit and I'm very happy.  I subscribed!"
11449,11450,B005C3IVN8,Delicious,"I grew up eating pancakes with real maple syrup, and the fake HFCS-based syrup just doesn't compare. Maple syrup is just wonderful with breakfast or as a sweetener in cooking. I had never had grade B maple syrup but recently decided to try it because it's a few dollars cheaper. Turns out I love it just as much if not more than the grade A syrup I was used to. It's not graded by quality like some foods, but rather by the color. Grade B is darker and has a stronger flavor. If you like one you'll like the other, and you'll like this Anderson's maple syrup. With Amazon's subscribe and save it's a much better deal than buying at my grocery store."
11468,11469,B004BW45Q8,Unique buttery flavor with less salt.,"I don't know if they use less salt or not, but all I can say is these olives were a pleasant surprise the first time I bought them in a store.  They have a wonderful buttery-ripe olive flavor and don't seem quite as salty as most olives do.  I wish these were easier to find at the grocery store, or that Amazon would carry this as a subscribe & save item so the shipping wouldn't be so high!  I can't imagine paying twice as much for shipping as the cost for one can of olives!  They don't weight that much!"
11473,11474,B0050ACWBA,a little pricy; no details on bag,"at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one can't pull up the bag to see details.<br />Like $80 per pound!"
11474,11475,B0013T717C,Best Coffee Ever,"My wife had some coffee at the Cafe d'Arte coffee shop when visiting her mother last year. She raved about it so much that I contacted their web site to sample some. It was great. Some friends who own a local restaurant (which prides itself on its good coffee) agreed that it was the best they ever had. I reordered several times, before deciding to look up the price on Amazon.<br />Short version: Same coffee, much better price."
11475,11476,B00015UC6G,Alternative Thickner!  Gluten-Free!,"This gluten-free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain-based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this."
11482,11483,B000GZUA6I,A fave,"We used to buy this pasta regularly at our local supermarkets, but a few years ago it just vanished...  We were very glad to stumble upon it on Amazon, and the transaction was, as usual, perfectly fine."
11486,11487,B004LKZVX6,delicious and refreshing and GREEN!,"This is a great way to trick children into drinking ""juice"", it is organic, flavorful and the berries give the tea a red/pink/purple color.  No more food coloring, artificial flavors or sweeteners.  Everything I could have asked for.  Even the packaging is Green, it is printed with soy ink.  This is a company you should be proud to support.  The only way it could be better is if it was made in my home town, so it would take less energy to get it into my tummy.  It is absolutely refreshing and nourishing."
11487,11488,B001EQ5D6U,Too Sweet,DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal.<br />The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE.
11515,11516,B0002UM1AA,absolutely the best!,"I've tried many different brands of rose jams and was alway disappointed because they were too sweet with very little flower flavoring. I'm so glad I found the Kafka brand of Rose Preserves because this tastes exactly as it should with subtle aroma of rose (you know you're getting the real thing in the Kafkas brand because you can see some bits of the petals in the jam!). This is great alone on toast, or paired with cream cheese or goat cheese. Even scoop some on a good brand of vanilla ice cream. Be creative! This is delicious!"
11520,11521,B0013M342K,Best in show!,Condiments add such vibrancy and depth to dishes and this mustard can stand alone!.  I had read about this mustard on a food blog written by a former Chez Panisse chef.  I knew I had to try it.  I'm hooked!  It is a sublime addition to vinaigrette but when spread on rye bread with a few slices of ham ......love at first bite!
11522,11523,B005HB4HGU,Amazing customer service,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!"
11563,11564,B001EQ59GE,Paprika supplier,I ordered this product as my previous paprika supply was nearing exhaustion.  My previous supply was the same brand and also in the 18 ounce package.  For some reason these large containers are no longer available in my local grocery stores so I turned to the internet for help.  To date I have not used any of this paprika but well when my current supply of homemade BBQ sauce is exhausted.<br /><br />I had not previously purchased from this supplier however the shipment delivery was prompt and it was well packaged.  I am very satisfied with the supplier and would not hesitate to purchase from them again.
11566,11567,B0031DJCJS,turtle power,For a friend who loves jellies and turtles . He said they were soft and chewy just the ways he likes them and even though they were his favourite animal he couldn't stop eating em .
11567,11568,B001HBI28S,Needs more lemon flavor,"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again."
11568,11569,B003HUFLYA,the perfect commuter dog treat,Not too dry<br />Not too wet<br />Not too hard<br />Not too soft<br /><br />Perfect for when you want to give your dog a treat and are heading out the door.  By the time you open the door and turn around to check on him the treat has been chomped to bit and swallowed  not fear of a choking while you walk out.
11569,11570,B0051IWQ26,Another great protein drink from Mix1!,"I am in love with the Mix 1 line of protein drinks.  As someone with a sensitive stomach, it has always been a challenge for me to find protein drinks that don't irritate my stomach and also taste great and have a good nutritional profile.  Mix 1 is the only brand I've found that meets all of these requirements.<br /><br />I ordered the Vanilla shake as soon as I saw that it was available on Amazon.  I really enjoy it!<br /><br />It has a very natural vanilla flavour and does not taste artificial like most vanilla-flavoured protein drinks.  It tastes like a delicious vanilla milkshake but without the heaviness of a real milkshake.  The consistency of this shake is a little bit thinner than the regular Mix 1 protein drinks that I am used to, but it is definitely not watery.  I really like it for breakfast, because in the morning I don't usually feel like downing a whole one of the regular Mix 1 protein drinks with the slightly thicker consistency...I prefer those in the afternoon."
11576,11577,B0050ILFCO,Don't Buy It!!!,"I was introduced to this brand in Aruba. This coffee is sold in Aruba's supermarkets and jar label is in spanish.<br />When I found it at Amazon I was very excited. I was immediately disappointed after first cup.<br />Coffee in Aruba is rich, tasty and very smooth. My wife and I had been enjoying this brand for more than 10 years.<br />The coffee sold in US is complete opposite to same brand sold in Aruba. I don't know why the same brand would be so<br />different unless it is a grey market product with a look alike label.<br />."
11577,11578,B0013TMSRK,"Rich, Dark and Delicious!!","Love this Coffee!  If you like a strong, dark, rich tasting cup of coffee this coffee is for you.  Another plus is that this coffee is easy on the stomach (not too acidic).  I will be coming back to Amazon for more."
11578,11579,B002DD3NM4,WAY TOO SPICY,"It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own."
11579,11580,B0007MXSRS,One of my Favorites,"I discovered this hot sauce while traveling around in Belize, it's on most tables in a lot of restaurants.  It has a lovely tang from the grapefruit, and is not tongue burning off hot, but a pleasing gentle heat.  I am never without!"
11580,11581,B001VJ3JI4,my cats wouldn't eat it...,my finicky cats wouldn't eat this food so I gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn't go to waste...
11582,11583,B000LGE158,Delicious!,"I was searching for a source of pure vanilla, without any fillers, but without the hassle of the vanilla bean.<br />This ground vanilla is amazing. No fillers, easy to use, amazing taste and aroma.<br />I will be purchasing this again!"
11583,11584,B001EQ4JS8,Delicious breakfast tea,"This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.<br /><br />Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!"
11585,11586,B0024NOZ16,all right by me !!!,"Gatorade was an acquired taste for me; but these days I can't stop drinking it. It's full of electrolytes and it does indeed have very few calories especially when you consider how it helps you rehydrate at the same time. You can drink this either cold from the refrigerator or warm from the shelf; I like it either way and actually when I drink it warm the flavor tastes even better.<br /><br />This pack comes in three flavors: fruit punch, lemon-lime and grape.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that this does have sugar (and carbs) in it; if you have concerns about sugar in your diet you should talk to your physician before drinking this.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
11586,11587,B006BAFIZK,The best chocolates,"These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses, they are called Blackstrap terrapins. Let me know if you like them."
11587,11588,B001E3TUGC,Low germination rates.,"These seeds are on the edge of their sell by date. (11/11)  Not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year.  Germination rates are at about 1/4.  Too early to tell much about the plants, but I will update again if they do well."
11589,11590,B002Q7ZYA6,Don't buy from this company,"I get around a shipment a week all year round from Amazon, and I can not remember ever writing a review. But I am making a point of expressing my anger over this product. I buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites. The package says it is organic and of the finest quality. It was possibly the worst tea I have ever tasted. In fact, after a couple of pots, I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are, this is not a tea company."
11591,11592,B0005YX2QA,"181 Years Old, And Still The Best!","I love steak, although I don't eat it all that often anymore. When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it ""A1,"" and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is ""A1""!"
11594,11595,B0037B0A7M,Outstanding Service and Quality!,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have."
11595,11596,B0007XXPUM,INSURANCE WILL PAY for hypoallergenic formula!!,"Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!"
11596,11597,B004V0SPUM,A little goes a long way,"I love this syrup, it doesnt have all those added ingredients, its not like dark amber syrup thats extra sweet. A little bit goes a long way. When i pour it on my waffles i only need to pour it in the middle and thats enough for 1 whole waffle. So if you think this little bottle wont work for big families you would be mistaken, i use half as much as i would with the fructose added syrups."
11597,11598,B003F1KL5K,Yorkies love these,"I buy these for my yorkies for beautiful hair and healthy hearts. They love the salmon paws with broccoli, and no diarrhea  issues<br />from the salmon, because of the broccoli. Good for their sensitive digestive systems, and nice chewy texture for their teeth, easily broken up is a big plus for tiny mouths. Seller is very prompt and never a problem."
11598,11599,B0026WL14E,The best cocktail pepperoni on the market!,"After Oberto cocktail pepperoni, no other will do.  It keeps well, and is a great low carb snack for the Atkins dieter.  I also like the large 32 ounce bag Amazon has available."
11631,11632,B0019IPKFC,Dog Treats,Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
11636,11637,B003292YLE,Great Nuts!,"The pistachios are large, fresh, and delicious!  This cute bag makes a perfect hostess gift, and a nice holiday gift for casual friends."
11637,11638,B0032RPLSY,Simply delicious flavor!,"I have been using butter ghee for cooking purposes, and found this product on Amazon.  The color is much darker than the grocery store product I had been using, and this product has a richer flavor as well.  I have been buying grassfed butter online as well, and it's clear there is a flavor difference.  I would recommend this product and will continue to buy it for cooking.  Butter is good for bread, ghee is better for cooking, and grass-fed is the best!"
11697,11698,B002LYSHSK,Moonstruck Chocolates,The first time I tried Moonstruck Chocolates I was hooked. These are the very best chocolate truffles !  I ordered the truffle box and it arrived quickly . Everyone should try a Moonstruck chocolate. It is really a treat !
11698,11699,B0086UI2II,WOW!!!! Can't be beat,"Nothing is better then a gluten free pretzel that taste like a pretzel! This is one of the few that are out there that actually taste like a pretzel, and if you are like me that matters."
11699,11700,B0046XAL7E,good stuff!!,The popcorn was great!! Everyone commented on how good it was and how it really tasted like movie theatre popcorn. I received it quickly and intact.
11705,11706,B005AZ3QEW,Most delicious oatmeal!,"This is by far the best oatmeal I have EVER put in my mouth. Lots of texture and most importantly delicious. My fav is usually just McCains Irish Oats, this far exceeds that. You wont be disappointed with this if you love oatmeal!"
11706,11707,B000J3GDNG,Tasty for Salmon,Use as a rub or mix in with canned salmon and mayo for a fast tasty dip.  Great stuff.
11707,11708,B003AAND88,All 3 of my cats love this brand/seafood flavor,"All 3 of my cats including the skittish/picky kitten adore these treats! My high-anxiety kitten hides all of the time and won't eat these same treats in the Milk flavor, but she always comes out and eats these Seafood treats! Couldn't be happier!"
11711,11712,B002U3IJ2Q,came expired,The product came at the end of August with expiration date of 01/07. As a result I could not eat it. Just waist of money
11713,11714,B001LQR9GK,Peanut Oil,What a great deal. I live in an area where you can almost NEVER get what you want in the size you want...when you want. So when there is a good deal..I get it. Then I discovered Amazon grocery. OMG!! I love it! CASES 'o food at amazing prices!! Anyway...this peanut oil is wonderful. Great size bottle for every day use. Excellent!
11715,11716,B002UVO1BG,Doesn't taste bad... but does not impress,"Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some ""healthy"" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal."
11717,11718,B000OLM74W,Yummy - better than the best American chocolate,"Caramilk bars are soooo good.  One of the pleasures of visiting Canada is getting yourself these Caramilk bars.  Along with Aero and Kit-kat, they are top of the line!<br /><br />If you happen to have read the article from the Food/Dining section of the New York Times, dated July 11, 2007, you will agree that British chocolates (and their commonwealth brethren) are da best!"
11719,11720,B000O3HWN6,This does NOT cause cancer -- do your own research,"Both previous reviewers rated this very low b/c they claim these drag&eacute;es cause cancer... not true. They may be referring to the SILVER or GOLD drag&eacute;es that are not longer available in CA b/c the FDA ruled that b/c there is trace amount of metal, they must state it's for decoration only, though people have been eating these for centuries... you get more metal in tap water and cooking in pans than from the few cookies you eat decorated with these during occassional celebrations. (BTW, the CA law can be traced to one lawyer who made this his sole platform... google it.)<br />These PEARL drag&eacute;es are perfectly safe and do not fall under the same FDA restrictions and are still available in most baking supply shops (who've pulled the metallic ones off their shelves just avoid legal trouble.) While those who are looking for this product will probably already know this, those who are exploring new ideas for decorating will benefit from learning the truth. (The only reason I don't rate this higher is b/c of shipping rates.) Happy Baking!"
11725,11726,B00153SSZU,My cats LOVE this very healthy food!,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!"
11736,11737,B003WP05BY,Great Gum!,"I used to chew this gum all of the time! My G-ma had over 250 packets of it in her basement! It tastes so good! When I was young, I'd eat 1 little Chicklet at a time! The flavor doesn't last that long, but it tastes amazing when it does!"
11743,11744,B001682OOA,Willibee's King Syrup,"I have use this product for years;came across the product on the East Coast, was hard to find on the West Coast, but with the internet the world has become smaller.  Thanks to Amazon I can continue to enjoy the product. This product is a thicker syrup than any other on the market.  I have yet to find another equal to it."
11757,11758,B004DOXI2Q,"great price, lots of cookies","I got this at a GREAT PRICE. I paid $8.67 ($10.20 without Subscribe and save) for 3 boxes that contain 4 separate 24oz bags. So you see, is a whole bunch of cookies. I'm abroad but I hear that my stepson's reaction was WOW, they'll all be gone tomorrow (teenager - resembles a bottomless pit) but it was a very good price. Cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate. Will buy again.<br />Btw, i just saw that the price on this was $29.95(My favorite things LLC), refresh a couple of times till you see $10.20, (fulfilled by amazon.com)"
11760,11761,B001EPPILQ,Does not taste like bubble tea from restaurants.,"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back."
11761,11762,B001E0QE4G,"Best Tea on Earth (No, I don't own company stock!)","Everyone in my house is addicted to this tea. We drink it iced. Make one or two pitchers of it a day. It's not sweetened, but has a subtle, natural sweetness to it. Feels refreshing and clean. It was also one of the few things I tolerated well when I was pregnant and routinely nauseated. I've heard this from other mothers too. Love it."
11763,11764,B002ULC4F6,Very different than the original,But VERY delicious just the same. If you're looking for a wee bit of a different flavor in the old favorite Oreo -- this is just what you're looking for! LOVE the size of the mini's too.
11764,11765,B00176BEME,The best dog treat,"Little BITZ chicken treats are the best treats I've found for my little dog. Not only are they good for him but he LOVES them. I'm so disappointed that the stores where I live stopped carrying them and thrilled to death that I can order them here. My chihuahua is very fussy because he's very spoiled. These treats are the only ones he'll eat, plus they're healthy and good for his teeth. Doesn't matter if they're round or bone-shaped. Great to use for training."
11765,11766,B002KNY7RC,Plants need to be tagged .,"The only problem I had with these plants were that I ordered six (6), 3 different colour flowers and  they weren't tagged. now i have to wait till they start flowering to see whats what. Having said that the plants arrived in  Excellent condition  and ahead of schedule,with all their leaves intact and still green . I have ordered from this supplier again, and will do so in the future."
11769,11770,B00099XLJE,There was a problem with the order...,"While 12 packages were to be sent out in 1 order ONLY 1 pack was sent out in 1 order BUT after contacting you and explaining the problem your company fixed it right away - AFTER ALL we all make mistakes, thanks for your handling the situation so quickly."
11776,11777,B0012KB4WU,Best of the florentines,"This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.  In our house, the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly, these florentines.  The egg soufles seem to be the favorites here - they ""hoover"" them down so fast they barely come up for air!  Recommend!"
11786,11787,B001225KGO,great flavor - not a killer,"works well as a rub on chicken<br /><br />also adds plenty of flavor when mixed in to meatloaf<br /><br />has some smoke, not too much fire"
11792,11793,B004P4TL8E,K-Cup Holder,Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want.
11892,11893,B000SSXTAM,Probably my most used luster dust!,Such a great little item to have in your cake/cookie decorating collection. Adds great accents. Silver is probably my most used color because it can be added to so many colors.<br /><br />Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3-4 at your local craft store - $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.
11902,11903,B001SB4VSC,The best chipotle in refried beans...How can you go wrong?,"San Marcos is by far the best brand of chipotle in adobo. Take that wonderful, smokey flavor and add it to refried beans and it's a no-brainer. These are a great medium hot bean."
11903,11904,B001CD1VI4,Limited edition flavor that deserves a try.....,"I have recently started buying Erin Baker's Breakfast cookies because they are a fast, easy and nutritious way for me to start my day.  This flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor, but fear not, these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about 40 seconds, and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie.<br /><br />This flavor is delicious-some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, raisins, dried apples, walnuts, coconut and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and carrot cake spices).  The cookie comes in at 310 calories, 18% fiber, with 17g of sugar and 15% iron.<br /><br />I was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me, as lunch for me is about 5.5 hours away, but I have no problem, this cookie is filling and delicious.  As with any fiber filled product, make sure you do drink fluids.<br /><br />If you do buy these or any of the other Breakfast cookies, be assured that you can freeze and microwave, so on the limited edition flavors, you can buy extra if you really love a particular flavor."
11955,11956,B001VIWUTE,I love Kopali Products!!!,"After purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUHG"">Kopali goldenberries</a>, I tried a few other Kopali snacks: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIRCZ6"">chocolate covered cacao nibs</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE"">chocolate covered banana</a>.<br /><br />The goldenberries are the best dried fruit I have ever had. They are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies. Grown in Columbia, goldenberries are high in antioxidants, bioflavonoids, fiber, and even contain protein. They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious. I expected them to be crispy, but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty. Each of the Kopali Organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack. You should try them (especially the goldenberries)!"
11964,11965,B001P1V2UK,Taste like plastic,"I bought these walnuts hoping they'd have a fresh, natural taste, better than the packaged nuts I find at my local grocery.  Unfortunately, the nuts I received had somehow absorbed a strong taste of plastic.  I took them out of the plastic tubs they were packed in and put them in another container I use that does not transfer odors or tastes onto the food.  Even so, after several weeks these nuts still tasted very unpleasantly of plastic."
11968,11969,B000ETGBOQ,You Can't Eat Just One Package,"I think Depeche Mode said it the best ""I Just Can't Get Enough"" and that is how I feel about these crackers.  They have a WONDERFUL flavor and are low in fat and calories.  A serving size is 17 crackers.  These are a great alternative to basic potato chips, macaroni salad and/or french fries.  Great by themselves, with dip or along your favorite sandwich.  Once you open a package you will be amazed how long before you're opening another."
11988,11989,B001THX20S,Heart shaped lucky bamboo,"The bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering, all intact and well packed.  However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15)."
11989,11990,B000SAFOLW,sugarless jerk seasoning,I added this to my order since I was going to be paying shipping charges anyway.  I didn't expect anything unusual.  There probably are as many jerk recipes as there are residents in Jamaica.  But this one surprised me pleasantly.  It wasn't full of sugar and added a really pleasant note to everything I cooked with it.  I will be buying it again.
11990,11991,B0000T15M8,The fruits of my labor,"When chatchi's favorite afternoon treat became mysteriously unavailable in the vending machine at work, chatchi panicked.  How would chatchi get through the work day without his Chuckles -- the delicious, fat-free candy that provides you with the sweet-filled enjoyment you earn every day.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon carries this delicious, chewy, fruity candy, and chatchi can get back to doing his job.<br /><br />chatchi's only complaint about Chuckles is the black licorice flavor.  chatchi normally likes black licorice, but this flavor is so overpowering, chatchi needs to eat it last, so as not to ruin the remaining cherry, orange, lemon and lime flavors.<br /><br />chatchi loves Chuckles."
11993,11994,B005LURC3C,Nice on a diet,"I looked around a lot for a non-water drink to have on a diet, and it was a long, gross search. This really fit the bill though, good taste, very light and didn't taste fake at all<br /><br />My advice though, is per packet disregard their instructions, use an entire pitcher of water for one packet or it is just way too potent."
11994,11995,B0026JSFUK,So good,"These bars are great, however, this item can be purchased for 7.49 at Sams Club.  Same box"
11996,11997,B000NMDWSM,Hit or Miss,"Super Bubble is my very favorite gum, and very hard to find here.  The box I received was a real hit or miss.  More than half the gum was brick hard - totally unchewable.  I've never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed. I will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future, but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth."
12000,12001,B00783F14M,The best dates I ever had,"Simply the best dates I've ever had. All natural, no preservatives or sugars (surprised? Some dates have added sugars). I stopped buying any other dates once I discovered those."
12001,12002,B007XZ1SJW,Fake saffron,"I ordered this saffron after looking at seller feedback and assumed that since this is expensive it will be premium quality.<br />But only after i put it in water for sometime, then the color of the flakes changed, and I realized that its a fake one.<br />Dont waste your time on this."
12002,12003,B004YMQ4KU,"Great product, and no problems with delivery.","I ordered this product because i love pasta but need to start modifying my diet because i want to start fighting competitively again and need to get myself back to peak performance. I was skeptical from all the talk of ""fishy smell and taste"". Thus being the reason i ordered the single pack. I prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup. I used chicken breasts cut into strips, boiled them into a broth with sliced carrots, green onions, and broccoli, and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles. Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work. I work 10 hour night shifts, so that's why i ate this before work. These are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book."
12009,12010,B0002AUTN6,mango ceylon tea,"this is a delicious tea, light and sweet with no aftertaste.  I highly recommend it to any tea drinkers who want a black tea, but one that is not too strong or bitter.  Needs no additional sweetening."
12010,12011,B007GDTL90,Desert in a bottle,I love this stuff.  I tried it earlier this summer while on Cape Cod and immediately had to go find some upon returning home!  It is like drinking chocolate!  It is dutch chocolate mixed with red wine.  mmmm.  New fave!
12011,12012,B003OP729U,Unhappy in Virginia,"The shipment was Prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2.<br />I love dark french roast coffee, but, this coffee tasted burnt and additionally, the flavor had overtones of trash Indonesian.  Not a pleasant experience."
12014,12015,B004A6F0Z0,nice starter kit,"This is a pretty nice starter kit for the price.  My only complaint would be the light damage done to my tree by the display box that it was obviously in for too long.  But just a few months later, and my bonsai is doing just great now!  There is new green growth on the old damaged branches, which is nice.  Still, overall a good deal for the price.  Would make a great gift!<br /><br />Ok, it's been 5 months now, and the tree is doing absolutely great!!  I woudn't worry AT ALL about how I said it came in the box... very strong and dependable tree regardless.  I'm VERY pleased with this tree, and it's now been moved to a bigger pot as it's doing so well!!  By far my FAVORITE of my 8 different bonsai trees ordered online!!<br /><br />Almost a year now, and still growing strong!  I've had three other bonsai plants die from different companies, but this one continues to thrive!  I'm now using the small pot it originally came in for another bonsai.. yes the pot it comes with is small, but it's very durable and great for starting small bonsai or other plants.  I'd still strongly recommend this starter kit to anyone interested in starting the art of bonsai.. and even for experienced growers.  It's such a wonderful kit.  The tree is healthy, the pot is durable, and the soil works great!"
12029,12030,B0081GVC98,Mwahahahaha!,"Ahhh...can you say ""Good Times!""? I am a big fan of jelly beans and these are now my favorite, perfect mix of flavors (good and...mysterious). I like to put them out in a little bowl, just randomly, before any company comes over...what's more enticing than a nice bowl full of bright jelly beans sitting out, ripe for the picking! That is until your unsuspecting guests ""roll the dice"", grab a few and perhaps ""enjoy"" some toothpaste & pencil shavings!!"
12032,12033,B0004M0GJ4,Good diet cereal,"This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content.  It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio.  It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor.  It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet.  My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store)."
12037,12038,B002L82VN8,Italian Sausage Success,"This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5"") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try."
12042,12043,B003H7YHUW,Good sardines!  But Ignorant Reviewers!,"This is the only brand I've been able to buy from any market that uses EXTRA VIRGIN Olive Oil. Most brands use cheaper non-virgin olive oil.<br /><br />I use a can of this stuff over leafy green salad and throw in a few cherry tomatoes. Shake it up and you have delicious high protein salad with no need for saturated fat/carb stuffed dressings.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers, they are entitled to their opinions, but I need to throw out a bit of education: The reason that these Sardines are not processed in the United States is because THERE ARE NO MORE SARDINE processors in the United States. The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.<br /><br />Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism. Blame yourselves for not buying American to save money only to complain about it later.<br /><br />Seriously people."
12054,12055,B001R5QS0S,Turkish Tea,"I ordered this after returning from Turkey where they served this to the tourists (me) who were shopping in their stores. Not a traditional Turkish drink - one developed to keep the tourists going (high in sugar) and happy. It worked while I was there, I bought a lot. Chocolate and Art Lover"
12058,12059,B0000DISV7,Yummy!,These arrived nice and fresh. They are a tad more tart than expected but I like them.
12061,12062,B000PY89AO,Fun for kids!,I bought several of these as a birthday party goody bag filler. This is basically ice cream flavored pop rocks but all of the kids loved them and is a very reasonable price.
12062,12063,B007VAPXB8,my dogs favorite,we pace the floor when stewed chicken is not available.  This is baby dogs favorite food mixed with chef michaels dry chicken kibble.  He loves this to distraction.  Never seems to get tired of it.
12063,12064,B0027Z8V4S,Best decaf I've tried so far,"Based on the reviews here, the price, and the fair trade aspect; I decided to give this coffee a try. I was very pleased with both the aroma and flavor: rich, complex, reminding me a bit of mocha though no actual chocolate flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a rich cup of coffee without the caffeine."
12077,12078,B001EQ4LEA,Great base!,"I was a huge fan of PDQ eggnog crystals and was sad when this product quit being produced. I happened upon this product and I'm so glad I took a chance. At first I made just one glassful and enjoyed it but something was missing and some of the crystals did not completely dissolve. I decided to make a half gallon of 1% organic milk in it's carton while adding nutmeg, cinnamon, and 2 tsp. of organic vanilla. I let it refrigerate over night and what a difference. Now it tastes more like real eggnog and is such an inexpensive easy to make year round treat. So today I will order another 9 pack or maybe 2 since one never knows how long a product will be stocked. Also AMZN definitively has the BEST price as other charge three dollars for ONE container. ENJOY!"
12087,12088,B0006HCFT6,Fresh smell and taste,Got a smaller size than 3 pound pack from Fisherman's Fleet; put in the freezer. Defrosted today and opened the bag. Sweet and fresh! No rancid fishy smell. Was very nice baked.
12088,12089,B007P60UXE,Yum!!,These macarons were beautifully packaged and tasted just as good as they looked! I think my favorite flavors were Dark Chocolate Raspberry and Coconut. Mostly likely will order more next time.
12090,12091,B00141UC9I,Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!,"Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]"
12292,12293,B0017U50KW,Makes Great Pastrami,"I used this to make homemade pastrami. Very hard to find locally and online. If you are dry curing meats this is necessary.  Made excellent Pastrami many times next I will have to try Bacon ""the maple Kind""."
12293,12294,B005QBFJGS,No flavor to speak of.,"Kamfen Noodle King -Beef flavored soup. This noodle soup comes in a carton waxed paper bowl. Included are noodles, and three flavor packets. You add boiling water after you add the packets of dehydrated vegetables, spices, and a paste of some sort.<br />  The noodles were starchy, and there was little or no vegetable flavor. The beef taste was probaly beef bullion cubes. All in all, a soup with very little flavor and my guess, high in sodium.<br />  There are much, much better ramen noodle soups available. You can cross this one off your list."
12294,12295,B005D0EGSE,Excellent quality,I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended.
12295,12296,B000YJTUZ8,Deliciously toothsome,"Wonderful stuff--cook it just like rice in a rice cooker to make rice or porridge. It has a wonderful texture, very toothsome. I use it like rice, heated with milk and sugar, and add a cup of cooked grain to my multi-grain bread.<br /><br />Note that the packaging has one typo in English. What is labeled ""Gordon Euryale Seeds"" in the ingredients should be ""Gorgon Euryale"". This ancient foodstuff is the seed of a water lily, grown in China for 3,000 years. Botanists named the genus ""Euryale"" after a mythical Greek Gorgon, sister to Medusa."
12296,12297,B001IW08AG,don't be a fool,"I love calypso lemonades, especially the strawberry and ocean blue but I would have to be a fool to order them for 60+ dollars when I can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for $20.  I went on line hoping to find a better price than the $1.69 I was paying.  This is not a good deal unless you are paying $5.12 a bottle"
12297,12298,B007N95IE4,baby gaining weight quickly,My premie baby born at 29 weeks weighing 1 lb 15 oz is gaining weight very nicely.  I breast fed for the first 4 months and fortified the breast milk with Neosure powder. I had to go back to work and placed him on the liquid formula.  Now he is on just Neosure every 3 hours. He is now about to turn 7 months and still not ready for solid foods but doing great with Neosure. He weighs 12 lbs. He loves this formula. I'm thrilled with his progress. Also I love the ease of use of these disposable bottles.
12298,12299,B0009XQSAY,useful item,"I have used this in many different ways and I like its ease of use and the fact that its a pantry item.<br /><br />That said, it doesnt have the texture of fresh cooked chicken and Ive found it best in things where its either mixed with something - like a chicken salad - or added into soup.<br /><br />I dont think it works well where a genuine chicken texture would be wanted (ie a stir fry or a chunky item where the chicken is in large peices)<br /><br />I think this is a very good item and worth having; just be aware that it isnt a perfect substitute for fresh cooked."
12314,12315,B0019LRWJQ,contains raspberry juice,"If you are going to take Noni take pure Noni, not one with juice added, I didn't read that it contained the raspberry juice"
12315,12316,B002RBTX80,excellent!,"This is my daughter's favorite. Lindt chocolate is one of the best I know on the market. But: this time I want to review also this shipper. This shipper deserves 10 stars!<br />The chocolate was shipped on days with extremely high temperatures and I was worried in what shape it's going arrive to. Surprise was on my side: all chocolates were in zipped food storage bag, which was inside of small styro-foam cooler together with 4 ice packs. And all that neatly accommodated inside of clean white carton box.<br />When I opened the cooler, the contain was still very cold! I could not be impressed more. And all that effort for value of $30 merchandise with the free shipping!!!! WOW!!!"
12323,12324,B0019SA1MY,Typical product,This is good smooth harissa.<br />This brand is the most commonly found in France and my Moroccan Grandma was swearing by it.<br />I would get a lot more if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous!
12331,12332,B00314ITOQ,The Perfect Finishing Touch!,"I was making Valentine Brownie Pops for my Grandsons' classroom party. I dipped them in white chocolate and sprinkled with Wilton's Micro Heart sprinkles. After the chocolate set I put them in individual bags and tied them closed with a red bow.<br /><br />I could not believe how many Moms asked me where I bought the Brownie Pops. I usually find fault with the presentation of my homemade goodies but I have to admit, these turned out awesome and did look professionally made."
12332,12333,B000NNQVES,wonderful snack,"These miniature hersheys are delicious, PERIOD. Very satisfying for a Diabetic, as well, although not a low calorie snack and fairly expensive."
12334,12335,B0019955UG,Excellent coffee,"My wife and I have been ordering Larry's for over a year, and we're very happy with it.  It's very good quality, consistent roast, and with ""subscribe and save"" discount plus the free shipping, at Amazon, it's about $9 a pound delivered whenever we want it.  It's also Fair Trade and Organic, so you can feel vaguely happy for some coffee grower in a far off place while drinking it.  Great coffee, convenient availability, we'll be ordering this as long as they keep sending it at this quality and price."
12336,12337,B000LKX1F0,"Danger, danger, Will Robinson!","I've sampled several varieties of Eden Organic beans; this is the only one which i found to taste truly awful.  Of course taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary.  My advice, before committing to a case purchase, is to first sample this variety by buying a single can from a local store.  If that's not an option for you, then you might consider moving on to another variety.  I can recommend their black, pinto, and great northern beans.  If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, you might consider their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMUOE"">Aduki Beans</a>.<br /><br />I like the fact that all Eden Organic beans are in BPA free cans.  Too bad that not all their canned products are BPA free (e.g. as of this writing, Eden canned tomatoes, soups, etc. have BPA linings)."
12341,12342,B001EPQVDA,Plantars is always great!,"We've had great success with all of the cashews we've tried. In doing the work as far as our best buy, the (4)16oz are a better buy than these at 21oz pack of 2."
12345,12346,B003O7AD9Y,Best Graham Cracker I've Ever Tasted,"I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in bricks to fill the box  -- this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!<br /><br />These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.<br /><br />I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!<br /><br />They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.<br /><br />I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make."
12349,12350,B000VZZS9M,These are to die for!,Very delicious! Made with butter so the caramel taste is excellent! The nuts are the topping on the cake! Yummy!
12351,12352,B001SAWUXG,great alternative!,"I have a gluten allergy and can't eat regular pasta.  After trying some pastas from my local market, I had given up on finding a tasty alternative.  This pasta is great.  You don't even taste the difference.  I make it for my friends and they don't know.<br /><br />The only thing is - it get softer faster than regular pasta so you shouldn't let it sit, or you shouldn't plan on saving some to eat the next day.  It might be too soft by then."
12352,12353,B0028A8ZEI,"WOW, I didn't know peanuts could be this good!!!","I'm a big fan of most nuts and especially peanuts, but these are the crunchiest, most flavorful peanuts that I've ever had, and just lightly salted, very light, only a little bit of oil. They're ""dangerously delicious"", like it's hard to stop eating them. You'd better buy the 3 or 4 can pack because the fisrt can will be gone in a few minutes."
12368,12369,B000LRFWTG,Fontinella Cheese,"I moved from Michigan to Georgia and had not be able to locate Fontinella Cheese. I found it on Amazon, have since ordered it several times!  The cheese was mailed from Parthenon Foods.  And where better to get cheese from than Wisconsin!  Thanks Amazon and Parthenon Foods!"
12369,12370,B0015DXT4K,Cream of Tartar at a bargain price,"I bought this for cooking; from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder, this cream of tartar is great.  I put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use, the remainder I keep sealed tightly in the freezer.  It will last quite a long time, and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small, over-priced jars in the grocery market."
12370,12371,B000FA9FCY,Knorr Bernaise,"For years I have used Knorr Bernaise sauce packets with steaks that I found at the grocery store.  I found it to be quite expensive (about $5.00 a packet plus milk and butter).  Upon researching some other food products, I found it on your site.  It was about 1/3 the price of the in store packets. Over time we have also started using it with chicken, even on baked potatoes, and it is delicious and makes anything you use with it taste more ""special"".  I will buy again and again!  Thanks Amazon!!!!!"
12372,12373,B000F5429A,Amazingly Lifelike,"I grew up in a diabetic household so I have always been aware of the difference between ""people"" food and ""diabetic"" food. Of course it was only recently that I was put on the non-people stuff exclusively.<br /><br />These candies are surprisingly satisfying. I have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. May be true but these little candies are quite nice.<br /><br />They are, in fact, hard. That is a nice change from diabetic candies when I was a child. They have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. I don't catch an aftertaste. So, when I ""need"" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. Won't mistake them for ""people"" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike."
12383,12384,B000DZH1A4,My new favorite cookie from Pamela's,"I've been eating gluten free for about seven years, and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. ""low"" many times in those years. When I first discovered them, I loved all the shortbread styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter, with and without chips.<br /><br />I love them all, but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all-time favorite. It's tender, chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others, which can be a little sweet for my taste, this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two, I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self-indulgent).<br /><br />Like all the Pamela's cookies, they're a little pricey, but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found. (Likewise for the Bob's Red Mill GF bread mixes, which are also wonderful.) Thanks, Amazon, for your great selection of GF foods."
12388,12389,B001FQ0VZM,Excellent taste,I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.
12389,12390,B002LO5SFA,Essential spice for everyday cooking,"I absolutely cannot be without my Spike - it is my one essential seasoning and I use it on almost everything.  Buying it in bulk is cost effective and insures that even when I can't find it in the stores, I'll never run out."
12395,12396,B005S283CW,Cheetos for kitties,"Kitty loves these a lot and demands them morning and night. She doesn't really like to eat anything else anymore, although I make her. I am sure they are very bad for her, and wonder what special poison Purina puts in them to make them irresistible. These are constantly out of stock, and I can't buy them in any store in town. They are crack for kitties."
12396,12397,B000FBM3YK,Deliciously different little wafer cookies,"I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"
12456,12457,B0079YD36I,"Great, bold coffee",This Gevalia French Roast coffee is fresh tasting and bold!  It's fantastic considering its preground coffee.  I really love it!
12459,12460,B001EO5UW4,A very fruity prune!!!,I wanted to try these prunes and was truly suprised at the taste they imparted. They are semi-sweet with a fruity perfume like aroma. The reason I gave them 4 stars is that they have a fairly large pit and it does take care in eating them. Caution: this is not a small child food!!
12462,12463,B001UUVKUS,"doesn't cook up quite as the recipes describe, but . . .","I purchased this red quinoa on a special deal here on Amazon, partly because I have a Vegetarian sister and a friend with gluten allergies, and so I'm always looking for new dishes that we can all eat and enjoy.  I'd never cooked quinoa before, though I'd recently sampled the white variety in a couscous dish at someone else's home.<br /><br />So far, the prewashed red quinoa seems to require longer cooking than most of the online recipes suggest, and I haven't been thrilled with the taste of the quinoa alone or with a few spices.  I read online that this red variety has an earthier flavor, and I'm not sure that it appeals to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is such a good source of nutrition that I've continued to experiment with using it in combination with other ingredients, where the quinoa flavor can be mixed with other tastes I enjoy more.  I don't regret buying this, but I'm not yet ready to replace rice or pasta or oatmeal in my diet with cooked quinoa only."
12463,12464,B001EQ4VXG,Nuts Over These Nuts,"I can't say enough about these nuts, they are fantastic!  I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor. I highly recommend this product."
12474,12475,B0005YLOH4,"Bananas, for baby... or for space flight",Anyone searching for stage 3 of gestational banana trajectories would be well advised to procure this item immediately.  It is an essential purchase.  That is all.
12475,12476,B0015G6QVK,Hollow and hard!,The bag we received from Amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store.  Were these a reject batch?  Certainly over baked or dried out!  Our bichon had a hard time biting into it.
12482,12483,B0065CH0KU,Hard to find,"So I order through Amazon and wah-lah instant ""happy"" and tasty too. Not pasty/powdery tasting as other instants and the full flavor of pistachio comes through to compliment desserts."
12483,12484,B008Z1EREG,My dog loves them,My dog absolutely loves these treats and he goes nuts every time I bring them out.  Not sure if they are helping his digestion but they don't seem to have any adverse affects either.
12484,12485,B0000DISV2,Fruit Slices,"This product is great. The flavor was to die for. I will purchase again, when my sugar high goes away?  : D"
12487,12488,B003U92X3A,good product,I tried successfully to make fresh rolls first time. Very easy. Good product. Worked consistently since. I recommend it highly.
12488,12489,B0018LHYCM,We love it,"This seasoning is supposed to taste like The Pepper Plant sauce, and I think it does.<br />According to the ingredients are salt, chili peppers, garlic, onion, spices, parsley.<br />Besides putting this on food at the table, we like it on popcorn, and use it a lot<br />in cooking where you might use a dash of cayenne or black pepper."
12494,12495,B000IKAL3S,My favorite Jelly Belly flavor,"I have been a huge fan of Jelly Bellys since I was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  I have always had a favorite.  At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out."
12496,12497,B007MI2RU4,Terrific Recovery Drink,I have been using Core Power (formerly Athlete's HoneyMilk) for over a year and I won't use any other product. I add it to smoothies and even use it in recipes that call for milk. If you are tired of the chalky tasting 'milks' out there then stop looking and start drinking Core Power.
12501,12502,B000GUTMGW,Gluten free but delicious!,"These muffins are great.  I've tried many gluten free foods and wasted so much money on things that tasted like cardboard.  I make these muffins  by substituting milk for the water and add 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I've tried adding pineapple but didn't like it as much as my version of banana muffins.  My daughter's boyfriend loves these muffins and has no idea that they are made from rice flour.  Another great Namaste item to try is the Spice Cake.  Just add some grated carrots, pineapple, coconut, walnuts and raisins and you've got a kick-butt Carrot Cake.  Thanks to Namaste for the wonderful products......I'm hooked!"
12503,12504,B002VVMAIQ,Excellent bag for make up,"This bag is awesome. It has shaved several minutes off my morning routine. I can see all my makeup easily. Bag folds up well with magnetic closure. Travels well. Not good if you are someone with a lot of make up. I can fit several eyeshadows, mascara, blush, under eye makeup, two eyeliner pencils, several eye shadow brushes, q-tips, and a few other items."
12512,12513,B001BTYAFU,Exactly what I needed,"For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5¢ apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine."
12514,12515,B001AHJMWO,"Hot ""Chocolate""?","This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere."
12520,12521,B008EG59KS,Tastes Great!,If you have the munchies....you'll like these. Get them on sale....the only downside is I wish they held up better in milk...they go soggy fast...and they still taste great.
12533,12534,B001O2DE1U,Great snack for kids/toddlers,"My 2-year old loves these cheerio-like banana flavored snacks. He prefers them to Cheerios. He has also tried the Blueberry flavored version of these snacks, and highly dislikes them, but I think that's just because he isn't a huge fan of blueberries. These are a hit, though!"
12541,12542,B005J7I8FS,Delicious wine!! Yummy!,"Great with BBQ, we have discovered and focusing on Team Fox for Parkinson's Research is what 4 Foxes Zinfandel is all about! Enjoy this wine to celebrate bbq's, birthdays or any celebration and know you've also helped raise money for Team Fox!<br />Cheers ~ Jessica Locke, Wines 4 Cures"
12542,12543,B000FEJ11U,"Not cheese, salt","We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping.  Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid.  There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess.  Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product.  Save your money."
12557,12558,B002E0ABTE,Great treat for dogs!,"This is a great treat and my Maltese loves them! I love them because of the organic ingredients, no artificial coloring or flavors, and it's low cal, which means I can offer her an extra treat now and then. However, I do think they could have come up with a better name for the product other than ""Get Naked"". I was reluctant to do a search for it assuming I'd end up on a porno site."
12558,12559,B000HDONOY,Incredible Edible,"Very good!!! Tried it years ago. Whole foods, for some reason, decided to stop carrying Eden Foods(in my area). So I am HAPPY that Amazon has come to the rescue. The garlic taste is subtle. Cooks up well. JUst wish that it could be pruchased by the bag and not the case.It's a must try."
12559,12560,B000BTK12M,Excellent quality,"I asked my brother, who is a chef, how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone. His comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift. He looked at the idea of buying something similar from Hickory Farm in the Mall where he lives since Mother's Day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the Mall. I had thought Hickory Farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that Wisconsinmade, this company whose product I am reviewing, did a far better job in quality and produce. I think that says it. For those who see only volume and not quality, stay with the grocery store, it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria.  I will note that I bought a couple of these products from this company and I have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality.  Quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well."
12562,12563,B000KPQPKE,Best or 2nd best mango chutney in the world,My wife thinks it is the best in the world and I think Stonewall Kitchen is the best
12563,12564,B003EMOJDA,Festive little seashells,We added these to some salt water taffy in the favors for my step-daughter's beach themed wedding. They were a lovely addition and realy added to the theme.
12564,12565,B000NMGBGM,What?,"What? This product is NOT what is showed in the photo. Instead of the box of Xtra Sour Goo which was shown, I recieved Monster Goo, which is NOT what I wanted to get. This company does not send you exactly what is in the photo, so watch out."
12565,12566,B004P6ISP4,STALE!! Nonreturnable and bad ingredient surprise - FDA food safety rules?,"It looks llike I just walked into a raw deal. The item is intolerably stale, and there is no recourse - I am simply stuck with it!<br />I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.<br /><br />Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.<br /><br />Strike one - utterly stale<br />Strike two - not returnable<br />Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA<br /><br />[Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]<br /><br />I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward. Not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product, it is also an inexcusable trap  - who wants to get stuck with waste and have their  money taken?!<br />Amazon is not what I'd remembered it to be!"
12567,12568,B001PNYKLG,Was so so,"I was very excited to get this product as I used to love their toasted pumpkin seed oil. Unfortunately I couldn't taste the pistachio flavor. So because of the price & lack of taste, I wouldn't purchase it again.<br /><br />Great company though. Michael is a great guy.<br /><br />Michelle"
12572,12573,B000E5C59U,2 peices of tiny metal found in 1 bag.,Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.
12573,12574,B005FAI4P8,Ir'a like a Thanksgiving SweetPotato&Carrot&Apples Meal for your Toddler!,"Now that my daughter is 2, I really appreciate that the HappyTot pouches really seem to keep the toddler's needs in mind, by offering a good size portion pouch for them, great flavors and especially this one, is my daughter's favorite in the veggie options.  I tasted it too since the combo of Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots really seemed like a ""Thanksgiving"" meal to me and wow, it was! It's like eating a pureed version of the Thanksgiving Meal side dish!  I loved this side dish with my Turkey so it's so funny that my daughter does too.  Chock full of Vitamin A, being organic and all veggies and fruits, it's a great snack for her and meal supplement to her other foods.  The portability is perfect and that extra dash of cinnamon, makes me have a great respect for the company which shows how they really want the product to be tasty while maintaining the healthy offerings too!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBPN2"">HAPPYBABY Happy Tot - Stage 4: Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots and Cinnamon, 4.22  Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>"
12574,12575,B000GG0BPW,Perfect for a cold night - tastes and smells GREAT!,I just love this tea! I only drink decaf after 6pm or so or I cannot sleep. I'm always on the lookout for a great unique tea - and this one fits to a T!<br /><br />I thought the vanilla flavor was not overly strong but you can clearly taste it. No bitter or strange after taste and it is suitably strong but not overly so.<br /><br />Enjoy!
12594,12595,B003AOIMLW,No Flavor really at all,"Once again, Paragon has disappointed with this flavor. The Hawaiian Tropic, simply did not carry much flavor, and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. I do not recommend this syrup concentrate."
12595,12596,B007FUA3AK,Delicious Raw Snack,These raw snacks are delicious. They are definately my favorite among the raw snack choices! If you are a raw foodist and miss the old fashioned Doritos you will surely enjoy these as a replacement. I am so glad to find the on Amazon. it is hard to find them in the stores since raw snack are hard to find! I am going to stock up! Problem is I eat way to many of them ( just like when I ate straight from the Doritos bag) ...atleast they are good for me!! You have to give them a try!!
12596,12597,B000F0EX2Q,Tone's 19.5oz  WHOLE BLACK PEPPERCORN,"Great value, love the large size 19.5 oz plastic container, love my pepper mills and use lots of whole peppercorns. This large size saves time buy not having to replenish my peppercorn supply so frequently. With the Holiday's fast approaching an ample supply of whole peppercorns is a must have kitchen item. The peppercorns have a fresh bright taste without being overpowering and are great in any season."
12603,12604,B000EW0XFQ,Not Cheerios and Not Applejacks either,I bought these (plainer box) at a Whole Foods. Definitely not worth the $4.29 I paid for them. They're so... bland. Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So there's little health value. They could've at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. I'll probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I can't afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again.
12615,12616,B0029K0XCY,Blah! What honestly happened here?!?,"I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and ""improved"" ""flavor-sucked-dry"" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.<br /><br />2 (deserved) stars."
12616,12617,B002B5BACY,"Love this popcorn, this $ STINKS!!!!!","Geez what a rip off, WINCO does carry this stuff, Winco is the only place I have found it (I look everywhere I go) and they only charge $2.79 a box & I save that outrageous shipping charge as well :)<br />I bought 8 boxes last time, I'm addicted!"
12618,12619,B009KP6HBM,Coffe shop quality capuccino at home,"I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a ""supermarket brand"". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos."
12621,12622,B005M3TAWE,Fantastic Belgian chocolates!,"My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.  10 years later, I ordered these as a Christmas present to my mom, knowing how much she loves these chocolates, and Leonidas, still does not disappoint. These were a total hit for the holidays and my mother, who does not eat dark chocolate, even gobbled up all of the dark chocolate pralines included in the holiday ballotin, they're that good! They are totally worth the expense."
12622,12623,B004DBXK8G,A Truly Dreadful Product,"This item is really Season's brand of hearts of palm, not Asian Harvest.  Nevertheless, they are awful.  Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!  The comparison between these and the brand carried occasionally by Costco, SunPix, is like night and day.  SunPix are tender, smooth, and taste great.  These are the exact opposite."
12623,12624,B001CCQCR0,A great treat,"I buy these for my neices, nephews, and grandsons. I've also been known to scarf one down on occasion. My only complaint is I've never received one of these in at least five or six shipments where the individual packets were broken in less than several hundred pieces. It doesn't effect the taste, but for around three bucks apiece, I mean?  Are the ones that aren't shattered sold separately?"
12630,12631,B0018Z5V7I,"Great for ""catkins"" diet","We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Surprisingly, they love quail.  Far more than chicken, and a bit more than turkey.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild."
12632,12633,B003O7DXF0,Very easy to make and tasty too,We have made this in a slow cooker which took longer than making it on the stove but was more convenient.  It is not quite as good as some home made and restaurant kheer I have tasted but still very nice

12638,12639,B004CS862A,"Decent sour candy, not great","I was hoping for the sourness of a hard Warheads candy with a sort of gummy center, but this was not it. The outside was only mildly sour, and it's gone within about 10-15 seconds, then you're left with the chewy (not so much gummy) center. I was hoping it would be chewy like a gummy worm, but it was actually just sticky and soft. Not very appealing. It stuck to my teeth constantly! I found myself sucking the little bit of sourness off, then spitting out the chewy part. Not that great for me, hopefully others will enjoy it!"
12639,12640,B006GZYPZY,My Bluebirds stayed all year,"Bluebirds aren't the only birds that love these.  Nuthatches and Woodpeckers love these too.  I mix them with mealworms in a small bluebird feeder and my bluebirds stayed all year.  They even nested in one of my nest boxes(4 or 5 fledglings), which is NOT out in the open.  My lot is mostly wooded.  The parents bring the young to the feeder as well.  I'm looking forward to having them again all winter too."

Normal oreos are not the same, the chocolate cookies have too many crumbs. Unfortunately, the GROCERY STORE stopped carrying the golden oreos with the chocolate filling and the white filling is just too sugary and creamy for me. The golden cookies have just the right texture. Make sure you don't leave the easy open package open, as they will get stale. I LOVE YOU GOLDEN OREOS WITH CHOCOLATE FILLING YOU ARE THE GR8EST!!!!"

12653,12654,B000FKL0EU,The new altered flavor of altoids wintergreen mints=YECH!,"Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list ""color (blue 1)"" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color ""blue 1"", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!"

12679,12680,B002Y1CIYY,What the heck?,"What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?"

12692,12693,B0055TCURC,Larabar Peanut Butter & Jelly,"Peanut Butter & Jelly is comforting isn't it?  Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.  I'll stick to the all fruit bars I think when it comes to the Larabars.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
12695,12696,B000N648JU,best dog food,"I have tried all kinds of food with my 3 dogs, and when I started giving them Merrick, their stools decreased in size, their coats gleam, and their energy is contagious.  I will never feed my babies another brand of food.  Worth every cent to keep my dogs happy and healthy.  Turducken and the Rainbow Trout dishes are their personal favorites."
12706,12707,B006AWVI12,Why wouldn't you buy it?,"The price is right. You're not going to find large containers like this is stores and you can use this in just about every recipe.<br />I use it in everything from buffalo wings, teryaki skewers, jerky, sausages, on eggs, etc. . .<br />It's spicy but it doesn't have an overpowering flavor.<br /><br />If you want to view some recipes, subscribe to foodwishes on youtube or visit his blog. He got me hooked on the stuff."
12707,12708,B001EQ5FY0,"Good, but not great.","The batter seems to require more moisture than the instructions call for and they don't give a baking time, but 4 minutes seems to work about right. The waffles taste more like regular waffles than Belgian Waffles. I was hoping they would have a more ""malty"" flavor."
12708,12709,B001ELLB4S,heavenly stuff,"I've tried all kinds of hemp powders and this is my favorite.  Hemp is a super source of EFA's and the protein is a highly available type due to the amount of different amino acids. It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?  Well, this hempshake is amazing -- the taste is really great.  I particularly like the chocolate.  And I'm impressed that although it tastes a 1000 times better than plain hemp powder, it only contains 80 calories and 7 grams of sugar.<br /><br />As for digestibility, they do add inulin, which is good for the gut, and I don't have any problem with it.  However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.<br /><br />In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my breakfast.  It contains hempmilk (natch), choco hempshake, cayenne, cinnamon, and frozen berries.  It is awesome."
12749,12750,B002UL1K6K,Simple enough for kids to even do on their own,"I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!"
12751,12752,B0005Z7ROW,Crunchy Cookie with a Hint of Chocolate and Orange,"Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner."

I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat. I think it took a little long and was not  to pleased with the shipping time. Over all the meat was great and I got my Gyro sandwich just  let down on the shipping.

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea)."

12847,12848,B002I7MSKI,Are you serious with this price?,"$59.99 for 6 boxes of 17.7 oz each ($10.00 / Item), plus $14 shipping? They have them in stores for about $5 - $6."
12848,12849,B002CGS6CE,Excellent rub,"Excellent rub for a good basic chicken.  Could have been more original, excellent, but not amazing."
12849,12850,B000AYFCJA,Good Deal,This was a good buy.  Tried using it for lemon meringue and it was great.  Tried it with baked pumpkin custard and it was awful.  Mostly use it for cream pies which always turn out great.
12850,12851,B0069DB330,No idea why it's so cheap.,This is a very mild Merlot. Extremely smooth chocolaty start with very slightly fruity middle. The finish is smooth but not as smooth as I'd like it. Lack's the richness I'm looking for in Merlot but really a great casual drink to enjoy with food.
12851,12852,B001FUT6LS,darkchocolate stevia,This is very good and tastes great with strawberries.  It is just like having chocolate dipped strawberries without all the calories.
12855,12856,B001EQ5LT4,Virginia's Very Best Jumbo Water-Blanched Salted Peanut,"Royal Oak is the very best at this moment.  There are a dozen other brands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40-ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.  I am not connected with this company in any way, other than as a customer."
12890,12891,B004U7QZ4Y,Smooth & Awakening!,"Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling."
12903,12904,B000SR1392,"Just OK, nothing special, but DAIRY-FREE!","This is a nice alternative for Tiramisu if you can't have any dairy, but it doesn't come close to the ""real thing.""  The flavor is similar to Tiramisu, but keep in mind that it is a ""cake,"" so the texture is nothing like the famous dessert."
12904,12905,B000IZTDWS,My Dog Loves These!,"My veterinary dermatologist recommended these for my 1 year old yellow lab as a crunchy replacement for rawhides while we try to figure out what he is allergic to.  He absolutely loves them!  A large piece only lasts for a few minutes for him, so they're not really a replacement for the rawhides, but at least it gives him something crunchy to chew on to clean his teeth and satisfy his need to chew.  The vet told me that they would stain my carpet, but they don't.  My only complaint is that they are a little expensive."
12906,12907,B001FA1B4I,Knott's Boysenberry Preserves,I've been looking for this preserve for my wife. This is her favorite preserves. She is a california girl and grew up in the knott's berry farm park area. She had this perserve most morings for breakfast. Could not find it any where here in Arkansas and thought I would try Amazon. I really made points when this package arrived. Great stuff. Thank you.
12907,12908,B0036FOV2O,Yummy coffee,"Best coffee I have found to buy. I used to buy<br />It at CostCo for at least half the cost on here.<br />CostCo no longer sells it. Hard to believe they<br />Would drop such a gem. Maybe(hopefully) they will<br />Bring it back. It's a very strong, aromatic,<br />Rich & choclatey coffee. Smooth and delicious.<br />Glad I found it here on Amazon for 2X the<br />Price! Love the coffee though."
12920,12921,B004WMB132,granola waffle mix,"Stonewall products, although pricey, are very good. High quality products with high taste value. Vendor rated very high. Product arrived early, and well packaged."
12922,12923,B007HP9T5S,Mango Madness,This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.  In the mango matcha there is the deliciousness of juicy ripe mangos with the balance of mangos that are just about ripe.  I particularly like this matcha in my morning smoothie!
12926,12927,B000WFPWQ0,Iams tarter treats,"My dog loves these treats and with her sensitive stomach, there are no problems plus they keep her teeth in great condition."
12927,12928,B00016JGYY,Dried cherries are delicious!,These dried Bing cherries are absolutely delicious. I have used them with wild rice and toasted pecans for a side dish. I plan to use them with a roast pork tenderloin soon. Excellent quality and price.
12930,12931,B000LRFZIY,Pretty Good,It's a great oil to start oil pulling with. Very satisfied except shipping could've been cheaper
12931,12932,B000FF3E2Q,"wonderful tea, works great","I usually never leave any reviews but since the product is worthy and there's no feedback at all I decided to do it. I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my breasts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my breasts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys)."
12932,12933,B0001392N2,Best Low Cal Truffle,"As a Physician and Surgeon - I am very concerned with the physical fitness of my patients. The Gayles Truffles are, without question, the best ""low cal"" chocolates I have ever tasted. My favorites are the milk chocolates, but they are all very good. Only drawback - they are expensive, and the portions are small, but satisfying.<br />Dr. J. Gerber, Los Angeles"
12933,12934,B001SAQDYS,At last!!!,"I've tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years.  None were better than mediocre and some were really awful.  I would always go back to my ""polpo"" which I make with a base of Muir Glen diced tomatoes - tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking.  Finally tried the Pastorelli.  BOY IS IT GOOD!!!!<br />Good tomatoey flavor, not over-herbed or garliced, not salty, and it held together when cooking rather than soggying up my crust.  My new best tomato friend.  2TB or so wii suffice for a pizza.  Great stuff!!!"
12942,12943,B001M2BMBQ,Best decaf I have tried,"I had searched for years for a decaf coffee that kept the wonderful flavor of a full-bodied coffee. I finally found it when I tried the Newman's Own Decaf! Great taste, great company, happy customer!"
12943,12944,B004H0ZCI4,Highest quality Marzipan. Read on for the story here.,"This generously sized, 7 ounce bar is covered in dark chocolate-a superb combination.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 ""The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames.""<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!"
12947,12948,B000ET93N2,Excelent flavor but many crackers broken,These are delicious crackers which stay nice and crispy even in humid weather. Unfortunately this particular packaging seems very prone to breaking in transit. They still taste good but I think I will order them in the different packaging where they seem to transport better.
12968,12969,B004LWX2SU,best formula for my baby,"Our daycare uses this formula as the default (if you don't provide your own), which is what promted us to try it out. Our daughter (although she can't talk to tell us for sure) likes it. We've tried all the name brands and this is the only one that doesn't seem to upset her stomach!"
12969,12970,B00438MLHK,Delicious!,"I recently got more cravings for sardines and I didn't want to pay $2-3 for a can of sardines. I saw these and thought hmm... maybe I'll give it a try. Definitely worth the money. So I think in my opinion it tastes really good. The smoke flavor is there and it enhances the flavor of sardines. It's a pretty decent portion and easy pull tab. I haven't tried any of the fancier sardines like from Spain or something, so I don't know the difference. These are great by themselves or on crackers :) Overall, I would buy again."
12973,12974,B002SW9J8W,Great if you like your chocolate with a side of body lotion,"I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring.<br />I had to throw the bag away."
12975,12976,B007GFLXVM,My favorite Starbucks blend!,"I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . . ""Spicy & Cherry"" and ""With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."""
12979,12980,B001HTKZK8,"add to the beans sauce two, too!",all you have to do is try it one time and you will understand why there are just not words to describe this more than wonderful sauce. they make it in a larger size and amazon would be good to offfer it in the larger size. and you will want to buy the larger size by the case.............it is great sauce!!!! this and hot stuff with little bear refried beasn. ole'
12980,12981,B000QY3MYG,Gift Worthy Box of Cookies,"The Presidor Allegro Crispy Cookies with Hazelnut Filling are a tasty, crunchy treat with kind of a dry center.  When I see filling, I think of creamy filling, but this was more of a dried Hazelnut paste.  The cookies have a good flavor and there are two rows of them in a nice box.  The box is presentable enough for the cookies to be a little gift for someone.  I enjoyed them hence the 4 stars, but I don't really crave them as a cookie favorite or 5 stars.  At the right price, I would buy them again."
12981,12982,B001KT60G8,Andes Candies,"These were great, we used them at my daughter's wedding (they are her favorite).  They were nice and fresh.  Thanks"
12984,12985,B001E5DXPO,great product!,awesome product at a great price - high quality human grade allergy friendly cookies!  dogs love em!
12989,12990,B00112CG4O,Not exactly what I expected,"The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not ""terrible"" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.<br /><br />I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit."
12990,12991,B0001VWGJQ,A hard to find product!,"I needed these Juniper berries fora Sauerbraten recipe.  Couldn't find them in any store, so was pleased to find them here.  Very pleased with transaction.  Will be back!"
12994,12995,B001VNEA9M,Fresh and cheaper than local,"Packaging was very good, comes in 2 separate well sealed containers/bags, in a cardboard box. I liked that it's divided into 2 portions which means freshness. It's much cheaper than buying it from ALL local big and small shops I've bought it from, and is fresher.<br /><br />My mom has always boiled some anise when someone had a stomachache and it seemed to work. I make a big pot and warm up a cup after certain meals that are a little heavy on the stomach or are gassy. Hope this helps."
12999,13000,B000EVT04C,How can you beat 5 lbs. of bite-sized bliss?,"Haribo's gummi strawberries are some of the tastiest candy available. I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!"
13021,13022,B001EPQ8XS,Very good for factory gnocchi,"Better texture and flavor than most. Machine made gnocchi will never approach handmade, sort of like boxed mashed potatoes vs homemade, but these are about as good as possible. Try boiling and then baking with gorgonzola and cream."
13022,13023,B000RYBDLE,Angelo Pietro Sesame Miso,"I have been using this product as a salad dressing for almost 20 years and, believe me, when I say that it is, without a doubt, tangy and absolutely delicious.  It also gives a wonderful taste to meat when used as a basting sauce when grilling or broiling.  Give it a try, I'm certain that you'll really like it."
13028,13029,B001HOVTOO,Halloween Gift Basket,"My grandkids live out of town so this was a perfect gift that they could all share and enjoy.  And what's better, as a kid, to receive a package in the mail?!"
13029,13030,B001VP88K2,"Good size, durable","I am writing this on behalf of my dog, who enjoys this product.  He's a fairly strong chewer, this is a sizable bone for 40 lb dog and it keeps him occupied.  So far have had no issues w/ splintering or chipping.  Would buy again."
13031,13032,B004CRCYCO,WEST COAST SPRING WATER MUCH BETTER!,"I first experienced Arrowhead spring water in Las Vegas.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted, so it made sense that when I returned home to Pennsylvania I'd load up on it.  To my chagrin you can't buy it anywhere East of Nevada. Thank goodness I could order it through Amazon.  My problem now becomes one of economics.  It's impractical to pay what I paid to get water here on a regular basis.  When I'm in Vegas I'll find a cheaper way to get it back, but I HAVE TO HAVE ARROWHEAD!!"
13032,13033,B000261NPI,High Quality and all around excellent.,"I have been on a quest to find the most nutritious dog food for the last year. After trying various brands this one is the definite and obvious winner. My dogs are seniors but they prefer the puppy recipe to the senior recipe. The puppy one is loaded with protein and nutrients which make their coats shine. They love the food, and are in great health, spirits and have boundless energy."
13033,13034,B0011XKHY4,airplane cookies! YUM!!,"These cookies are so good. I love them. I first had them on our round-trip flight to Hawaii last fall. I asked for extra. I recently discovered them at a national chain drugstore and here they are on amazon, too! They are so delicious but it's hard to stop eating them once you start...or so I hear...haha. Enjoy!"
13046,13047,B002FKG5MA,great coffee,"There is nothing better then good coffee at a good price, well flavored, great taste, even better out of my Red Soxs mugs, also a Amazon purchase.  Great deal from warehouse."
13047,13048,B001FA1K5S,Better and Cheaper Than US Version,"We got Mexican Nesquik because it was cheaper, but I was surprised when it actually tasted different and better than the US version.  It has a darker chocolate taste which I really like."
13049,13050,B0045TDE46,"Tasty, but instructions are way off","The packages are MUCH smaller than normal store packets, and the instructions are way off. If you make muffins, the instructions advise that you will get 6-8. Not on this planet. It takes 2 packages to get that. Not such a great $$ deal after all. In addition, it calls for 2/3 cup water or milk. That makes soup. You need maybe half that to get a proper batter consistency. Two stars off for all that.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn-ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.<br /><br />While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower. Too much money for a too-small bag of cornmeal and baking powder."
13051,13052,B0056AL512,Super Tasty,Made with things that are good for you it is also a tasty brew. I drink it before bedtime and it actually helps me sleep better!
13052,13053,B000LRH7WG,Taste like home made in Greece,"My Family used to Lived in South of Greece (Attika)<br />Few of my friends used to share home made Olive oil.<br />it is common that regular House hold in Greece produce own olive oil<br />at home. its all good and so wonderful!<br />So rich in Good taste. very hard to fine in any finest<br />market,(even in Greece)<br />Olive oil it self is enchance flavor of any dish or dessert.<br />Now this one comes in large portion of 3 Litre!<br />This seller is so honest always gives you a honest<br />exchange rate refrect on the purchase.<br />Now My family enjoy this from Breakfast to Dinner.<br />Replaces all Butter should use.<br />makes great Gerato too!<br />You can too!"
13053,13054,B000GZW73M,Delighted,"My Solo Apricot Filling arrived this afternoon, only six days after I placed my order, with free shipping. It's just as I remembered it from my childhood, when my mother made apricot turnovers and kolacki! I'm thrilled that I now have a supply of twelve cans; it's been increasingly hard to find in my local markets."
13055,13056,B000OOT3WS,THESE CANDIES DO NOT CONTAIN THE ENZYME PEPSIN!!!,"To quote from the Pure Fun website:<br /><br />  ""Today the flavor we call Pepsin is a form of Wintergreen [ . . . ] Pure Fun Pepsin is derived from Wintergreen plant extract [ . . . ] with the old-fashioned flavor we enjoyed in the 1950's and 60's.""<br /><br />Think of Wintergreen LifeSavers, and you'll know approximately what this candy tastes like (minus the chalky LifeSaver texture).  You may not like the taste, but the information about the dangers of real pepsin is not relevant to this candy.  The only reason I can imagine for Pure Fun to use the misleading name ""Pepsin"" would be if they are trying to associate the digestion-aiding properties of pepsin enzyme with this wintergreen candy.  Looks like they made a mistake."
13057,13058,B000JUK4OS,loved it!,"so even though i did not like everything that was in the sampler (space food sticks are just like energy bars from the gym), the sampler was exactly what it said it would be, and then some. i was surprised by how much was in the sampler, you get a lot for your money. whats best is you get multiple ice cream bars, and those are great! just break off a piece and let it melt on your tongue and youll see it really is ice cream! took it to a backyard bbq and it was a hit! have not tried the peaches or apples yet, but the ice cream alone makes this a five star product!"
13077,13078,B002GWHAXK,very good coffee at a great price,"you do need to know that five pounds is a bunch of coffee. if you have two people drinking about 4-6 cups a day (i think our grind & brew carafe counts five ounces as a cup), which i think was our rate, it will take you about month to five weeks to get through it. after four weeks it can lose a good deal of its flavor, so you want to try to use it before then.  we keep the unused portion in ziploc gallon bags, otherwise i don't think we would even get four to five weeks out of it.  for the price, you can't beat it, and if the last little bit gets a little stale then you can always move on to another bag or realize that you need to find someone to coffee-pool with next time you order a five pound bag. they also sell one pound bags, which i've not tried yet."
13095,13096,B004UB832C,Bought instead of 2%,"This is an excellent product, i bought it after the price of 2% parmalat doubled in price, guess the skim is better for me anyway. Living in the country and not having immediate access to grocery stores having shelf stable milk is a life saver. I keep at least one in the refrigerator at all times."
13096,13097,B003WKTRNQ,Great bones but confused about price,"These bones are awesome!  My dogs love them - it's great.<br /><br />I purchased these for $22, and went back to buy some more and now they are $32 which is a huge increase in price.  I don't understand why there was this big increase?  I don't really want to buy them anymore."
13097,13098,B001A1TVYO,Excellent Sprouting Seed,"I'd been devastated when, recently, my previous favorite fenugreek seeds (which i use only for sprouts) began having 15% ""HARD"" (i.e., wouldn't soften even with 24 hours of soaking) seeds.  These have had 0% hard seeds and sprouted to 1/2 inch sprouts after soaking 24 and then growing 24 hours.  Very gratifying.  Have them every day!"
13103,13104,B00125EVJS,Seasoning with a kick,I used JCS Oxtail & Stew Seasoning as part of my cooking routine. The flavors blended well with my stew and vegetables to give it a unique bold flavor. I would recommend this seasoning as a woman's spice essential.
13104,13105,B002TMV34E,Mystery Coffee Tastes Pretty Good,"Many coffee containers, whether they're bags or cans, tell you what you'll be getting inside.  Although there is ample advertising and promotional information printed on the bag, I was left clueless as to where the arabica beans were grown.  That's why I called this ""mystery coffee.""  My usual brew is made from freshly-ground, all Colombian grown 100% arabica beans from a top-rated coffee supplier.<br /><br />Since I'm a serious coffee drinker, I would not usually buy such small bags of it.  An 11-ounce bag will make about three full 10-cup pots of coffee for me at the strength that I usually brew (1 level tablespoon full of ground coffee per cup brewed which is half-again more than Melitta recommends).  Melitta used such a strong adhesive to seal the bag, I had to nearly destroy the top of the bag to get into it.  Once opened, the bag yielded a hearty, pleasant fragrance of freshly-ground coffee.  I expected that it would brew good-tasting coffee with a bold taste and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Melitta recommends using their brand of filters because they've ground the coffee finely to extract the maximum flavor, but my usual store-brand filters worked just fine.  If your coffee preference is for bold but not bitter over mild you'll probably find this coffee to be satisfying; more like Starbucks than Dunkin' Donuts coffee.<br /><br />Ultimately choosing a favorite brand of coffee, for most people, is a matter of taste and cost.  This collection is certainly worth considering if you like your brew to be potent and to actually taste like coffee instead of like something else or wish to share this tasty coffee experience by giving one of these small bags as a gift.  I enjoyed this coffee but wouldn't buy such small bags of it regularly for my own consumption.  My top-rated bean coffee comes in more convenient packaging and costs me less."
13204,13205,B005GCSMR0,Great Product,"I have been eating this cereal for years. It initially had oat bran as well as the current corn, wheat and rice. I never eat ""sweet"" cerals but this is good with just a very very slight hint of sweetness. Eat it right away and it is very crisp and crunchy or let it stay in the milk a bit and it gets more like oatmeal. Great stuff. Wish I could find it in the grocery but this is another case where Amazon comes through. $9.99 a box...you gotta be kidding!No cereal is worth that much but don't despair because other sellers have it for normal reasonable prices."
13205,13206,B000CDNL8I,Outstanding Seller,"We love having fun with the Gold Flakes.  Guests chuckle and ohh and ahh over having gold shaken into their cocktals.<br /><br />The Edible Gold Flakes also make the ultimate hostess gift.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller, the gold always arrives quickly."
13207,13208,B005P0U1B8,Yummy,"My kids & I love these, they are like rice krispie treats but not as sweet, similar texture and a great snack."
13208,13209,B0045H1ZL2,Great Product... Raised prices after 2 purchases,"We are a small company that does BBQ 6 days a week. We were purchasing BBQ sauce monthly for the buisness. We bought about 24 bottles a month. Two months ago I found it on Amazon.com for ALOT less expensive. I have now ordered it 2 months in a row. I logged back on this month to do my monthly purchase and I went onto my previous purchases and clicked onto the link...I than found the BBQ sauce went up quite a bit and the shipping is now almost doubled. Same seller as before. I dont get it. How is it the pricing goes up so much from one month to another. Last month I paid $50.40 with shipping and handling, this month I am expected to pay $84.10. How did that happen?"
13209,13210,B0049LUEKC,first time taster,"This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds."
13215,13216,B004QQA216,Great oil for baking with,love this stuff although it's not HOT enough so I'll be seeking a more concentrate product. I'm sure that there's some hotter cinnamon oil out there.
13216,13217,B005CGUUNE,Can't get enough,"My cat loves these! When I take the container out, she get super excited and eats every last flake I give her. She's a very picky eater, and I've never seen her so happy with a treat before."
13218,13219,B0038RLIYO,Best flavor yet,"This is about the 5th type of Xylitol sweetener I have tried.  I threw away most of the previous one.  So when I received this ""Ideal"" I was skeptical...well...it is delicious!  No off-taste, just wonderful."
13232,13233,B003ZXFX2E,"great cracker, but...","These crackers are great.  Unfortunately, every box I've bought is about 50% broken.  And that's from several different stores."
13238,13239,B007L4A77E,Cheap eggs are cheap.,"These plastic eggs are terrible quality.  I bought them to use as centers for my classroom.  I don't expect they will last much wear and tear with students because the plastic is thin, the hinges are weak, and there are even holes in some of the eggs.  I would NOT buy this product again.  I would DEFINITELY not buy these eggs for Easter to put inside it--the eggs feel dirty and filmy and it would creep me out to put candy inside them.  There's a reason these are some of the most inexpensive--the quality is sub-par and disappointing."
13240,13241,B004OLKF60,Strong and Smoky,"This is a strong, smoky coffee that can make you feel like a sophisticated coffee snob in the morning. It's smooth, rich, and velvety, and I always feel like a genius after brewing it, like, 'yeah, I just brewed this and it's so good. I am a coffee master.' That being said, it's almost a tad too strong for me - but I tend to prefer medium roasts. If you're looking for a strong coffee, I'd recommend checking this out."
13271,13272,B005ZZN34U,Coffee was OK,I was glad to get the 3 boxes of Starbucks Coffee and it was ok. It may have been around for awhile as the coffee was good but didn't taste Fresh.
13273,13274,B00474HER2,Good mushrooms produced in USA,"Canned mushrooms produced in the USA are hard to find these days (many are products of China).  Organic canned mushrooms can also be quite hard to find.  In this product you have all that, and they are very good to boot!"
13280,13281,B003H26J5I,Tried them for the first time today......,"Today I tried the spaghetti Tofu Shirataki noodles by House Foods. I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre-preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.<br /><br />Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir-fry vegetable medley. I then added some broth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up, bring to a boil, and turn it off.<br /><br />Really it tasted great- very much like the ramen noodles.  It is important to note that the noodles themselves have ""no flavor"" and actually absorb the flavor of whatever ingredients you are cooking them in. So let them sit it whatever flavor suits you."
13308,13309,B004BCV53O,good for cats,"I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas/GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B-12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this brand but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a ""drama queen"" & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won;t eat the food) so getting anything into him is helpful & the baby food is good for both nutrition & for hydration.My husband & I will do most anything to keep him happy & enjoying his quality of life for as long as possible & this baby food helps us do that for him. Our other 3 cats also enjoy this as a sometimes treat so it works well for our family."
13317,13318,B004286RC6,Great!,"There were several different flavors of truffles in the box and they were all great. If you like chocolate truffles, you are going to love this box of candy."
13326,13327,B001BSBFUO,Jack loves these,"These are basically moldable bits of chicken putty, and my liver-spotted dalmatian Jack loves them. Every morning he takes a big fish oil capsule that he thinks is weird on its own and two pills. I tear one of these pill pockets in half, then mush one half of the half around the fish oil and mush the other pills into the other half of the half, and he gobbles it all up without complaint. I'm stingy with these, because they get a little expensive when you have to use them every day, but they really are just the thing for getting a dog to take medicine. I'd use as many of them as necesary to get Jack to take his meds, but so far the economy approach is working. Great product!"
13399,13400,B0049DIU3I,Reminds me of old time licorice - texture is a bit off,I consider myself a connoisseur of types when it comes to sugar-free candy.  I have been in search of the perfect sugar-free treat for years and I may have found it!  These licorice flavored candies pack a great flavor punch - remind me of chewing on black licorice jelly beans as a kid.  The texture is a bit too grainy but there is no weird aspartame-type aftertaste to them so I can overlook the grain.  Just be conscious of the warning on the label and limit yourself to 4!
13401,13402,B003D5JJEC,"Great taste, shame about the pieces.","Like the taste and assortment of these, sadly they arrived in the same box as 12 cans and didn't like it very much!! 0/10 to the packing dept."
13404,13405,B002BGBM5S,My Favorite Cold Drink....,"I love this tea. I make it strong and mix it with a splash of lemonade.  I copied a similar tea from Starbucks.  I like mine better, plus...it costs less!"
13405,13406,B001E5DQGK,Delicious but not the best,"This truffle oil is quite good but I prefer the Plantin brand, which is from France. The Urbani is from Italy. The Plantin is more expensive but it is oh so delicious. I have tried both black and white and both are good. Black is a bit stronger, or more pungent. In any event, this is a very healthy alternative to butter! Enjoy!"
13427,13428,B002MXSAD2,Great Item,"I purchased this when I was planning to make and freeze baby food for my daughter. What I like about them is that they are easy to pop after food is frozen, unlike regular ice trays. After they freeze, I just put the baby food in freezer bags and it's working great. Gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey."
13504,13505,B004E42QMI,Delightful treat!,"I wasn't sure what these consisted of when I ordered them,but I was very pleased w/the taste & the texture... Very sweet w/a kind of sugary marshmallow texture :)"
13505,13506,B005H19WLK,"Dense bread/cake, intense chocolate swirls, hint of chocolate liquor","This is the dense flavorful chocolate cake associated with eastern European Jewish tradition, although anyone who loves cake and chocolate will appreciate this. This cake is especially generous with the chocolate, which is more dark chocolate than milk chocolate (but that is healthy, right?). The texture is more like bread than cake, but in a good way. I would buy it again, or its sister cake, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096R2R6S"">Greens Mini Cinnamon Babka - 16 Oz</a>.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? I am not sure but I think I detect more than just a hint of chocolate liquor. Which I like. But if there were small children in the house it could be a problem. The label makes no mention of the chocolate liquor but there is clearly a pleasant alcohol flavor. Similar to the alcohol flavor one finds in a really good rum cake.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if this chocolate babka is out of stock, you can't go wrong with this amazing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJOROU"">Tortuga Caribbean Rum Cake, Golden Original, 33-Ounce Cake</a>.

13506,13507,B0001W2W62,Good Sprouts!,Have started sprouting again and am enjoying these seeds.  I use them in my salads and sandwiches.  They add a good crunch and help with a flavor bite.  The amount of radish seeds seem to give the right spice to the mixture.
13542,13543,B000AYDHD8,good tasting poptart,"These lowfat Frosted Strawberry ones taste just as good as the others, I honestly can't tell the difference."
13550,13551,B001B5VMDM,Interesting.,My first time having soda flavored candy. It breaks into a powder on the first bite and really does taste like the Ramune soda. It is also fun to find the ones that have little faces on them.
13551,13552,B000LQLV6U,These are ok.,"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure."
13559,13560,B000VMI8W4,Dog loves this,"Frankly, I have no idea if this really cleans the dog's teeth.  But, our excitable dog can become a nuisance when company comes.  By the time he finishes one of these large treats, he has calmed down."
13564,13565,B0024NXUZI,Best soda bar none!!!,"Diet Pepsi is the best soda available, anywhere!!!  When traveling outside the U.S. I always ask for it and if it's not available,I prefer to have plain carbonated water rather than the ""other"" cola.  My refrigerator always, and I mean always, has at least five or six bottles on the shelf and my pantry holds another 12 or so bottles.  I can only hope that it will always be manufactured."
13567,13568,B006U6NG68,BEWARE this rip-off!,"I paid $15 for Kit Kat 4pk 70% Cocoa Dark Chocolate and received ONE pack, not four. When I queried the company, they ignored me. Unless you are comfortable paying $15 for a small candy bar, I would avoid these guys."
13568,13569,B001ZSF9EI,My Cat Loves these!,"Although a bit hard for my cat to chew at first, she loves them now and can't wait to get her treats!"
13577,13578,B005D2IKUW,Lovely,"The tea is what it was advertised as! The tea tin and packaging were also in excellent condition. The tea tastes nice, just like normal english breakfast. They are non string tea bags, round instead. Lovely for a gift!"
13578,13579,B00171KCB8,great tasting noodles!,"I used to eat this all the time when I was a kid but unfortunately, they stopped producing it for a while. Then suddenly, its back again. I love it! Its really, really tasty :)"
13581,13582,B001E5DQGU,good stuff,"I like this. I have had more expensive truffle oils before, but I am perfectly happy with this. Just because it's not from france doesn't mean its not good! A good sparkeling wine (champange) from california, is still better than a bad one from champange france. The tase is waht I expected. Mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff, and arrived ok. Truffles, I understand, grow in many places in the world. I haven't tasted the finest quality (cannot find it, much less afford it), but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils I have tasted (that were more expensive). I have no reservations recommending it, as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle, i.e its a bit stronger of a taste. It all what you like and can afford. Its great stuff!<br /><br />The other reviewer should have asked for a replacement, not a refund. You shouldn't derogate the product for something that is the fault of the shipping carrier, and possibly the packer."
13592,13593,B005WIO4CU,Delicious,"The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don't ever use any added sweeteners."
13593,13594,B0016889C6,Vernors Ginger Ale,"Love the ginger ale! Best ever. Took a bit to get it but it was worth the wait.However, my credit card was comprimised when I ordered from Amazon. I probably won't order from them again."
13597,13598,B001E5E33A,Excellent,We have been waiting for Earl Grey Decaf and now it is here.  My wife love it.  She now can drink either Earl Grey or English Breakfast.  It gives her a choice.<br /><br />The Earl Grey is not as strong as the English Breakfast.
13642,13643,B004YGQKLE,Great chocolate for cafe mochas,"The difference between an average cafe mocha and a fabulous, smooth beverage to be savored, is in the quality of the chocolate. Mocha powders, ground chocolate and ordinary milk chocolate chips are no substitute.  Ghiradelli Barista Dark Chocolate Chips are the answer for intense flavor and pure, velvety chocolate. These Ghiradelli chips will turn your not-so-great, made-at-home mocha into a gourmet cafe.  Read more at mocha.[...]"
13644,13645,B005OD8HQM,Shareable.,"Shared it with some Navy folk, and i got a lot of requests for more. Still one of my fave treats."
13645,13646,B002TM38MY,My addiction,"Light. Crispy. Chocolate!  I had the hardest time finding these delicious cookies, but finally an Amazon vendor got some in and I ordered right away. The airy wafers are coated in milk chocolate without being weighed down by it. Yum."
13646,13647,B004H1SPIW,sesame confection with pistachios,"Please see my other review for more details (vanilla Halvah).<br /><br />This is a confection bar with fine-ground sesame seeds with pistachios mixed in.<br /><br />If you like sesame, and pistachio, you will probably like Halvah."
13647,13648,B0045PHBSA,Best chocolate ever!,This chocolate is the best thing ever - made my dad really happy to get a shipment of these for Father's Day
13648,13649,B000GWHFZA,Purchase,"Wal-Mart sells this product. Tried to find on internet what grocery store carried it, found none. It was a freak accident when i saw it in Wal-Mart $2.96 for large container!!!!"
13664,13665,B0032K3OI0,"Don't delay, buy this TODAY!","So, the world's best gluten free oatmeal has met its match in its delicious cold-blooded cousin, Glutenfreeda's gluten free granola!  The individual serving pouches are handy for snacks on the go, and assist in those moments when one might wish to overindulge in this decadent-tasting, yet extraordinarily healthful cereal.  Generously interspersed with the delicious oats are yummy toasted nuts and perfectly dried fruits.  The only regret I have about this product is when I'm down to my last packet, which is why I'll purchase it from Amazon by the case-full.  You'd better hurry and order yours, too, because I might just hoard it all for myself!"
13668,13669,B000XXVI5U,Beautiful bonsai,"Thanks to thoughtful packaging my bonsai arrived 100% intact. Not even a leaf got knocked off during shipping. It's very healthy, came in a pretty ceramic pot and dark gravel that complements the leathery green leaves. The instructions were very thorough and helpful. I can't wait for the flowers to show up!"
13672,13673,B000FLRNK4,Good Caramel Popcorn,great not the cheap kind - i bought the 6.5 gallon one<br />and has tons of caramel on the popcorn unlike cheaper products - brush brush brush LOL<br />taste and look fresh
13673,13674,B000V8XXZK,Super Sour Blue,"I love sour candy.  The more sour, the better.  And these sour belts are SOUR!!<br /><br />They also turn your mouth completely blue.  Lips, tongue, and even your teeth.  Especially if you overdo it, like I tend to do.  They so addictive!<br /><br />The blue food coloring is easily brushed off the teeth, but expect at least a full day before your tongue and lips turn back to normal.<br /><br />These babies contain malic acid, the secret to their incredible sourness.  Taken in too great a quantity, malic acid can have an odd effect on the taste buds.  Nothing you eat later will taste right.  The effect goes away after about a day, too.<br /><br />Sounds like an awful lot of fuss just to have sour belts, huh?  But if you like sour like I like sour, it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These belts are not delivered in a hard plastic case, but in a clear plastic bag.  You get a lot of them!  Store them in a resealable container to keep them soft and fresh."
13675,13676,B004N5KTP4,Yum...,"These arrived intact and not melted.  I was happy with the product and the price, and Amazon's quick delivery.  These and the peanut butter eggs are my favorite because they seem to have more peanut butter than the regular PB cups."
13678,13679,B0018CK2Y8,Not our best idea,"As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did."
13699,13700,B002CZHWXE,Good for limited diets,"My dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types I tried. The dogs ate it easily (although without great gusto) and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it.  Vet recommended. I wouldn't use for day to day dog food, since other flavors without "" limited ingredients"" appeal to the dogs more."
13703,13704,B003J9XVQY,great cordials,"These cordials are very hard to find, so I was so excited to find them online, that I ordered 3 bags and have been enjoying them ever since."
13704,13705,B000LRIIC4,fabulous,fabulous and very tasty item.  I imeeditaley stuffed a dozen with chopped lamb and rice and seasonings.  let them sit in a pickling brine over night...<br />absolutely fantastic...<br />yummu
13705,13706,B00513J4D0,"Fussie Cat is a hit with my ""fussie cats.""","This is an extremely high quality cat food that tastes (according to the cats) as good as it looks. I have seven (yes, seven) cats, all rescues who have become spoiled brats and who enjoy being difficult to please. They didn't care for all of the Fussie Cat flavors, but the tuna with shrimp and the tuna with salmon were both big hits and we stocked up.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have a food of this quality to feed them!"
13710,13711,B003C5NUYI,It really helped my dog!,"I have a 9 year old lab mix, and she is over weight and simply not active.  She would breath really heavily even when she was just laying around!  I assumed that her not being very active had to do with age, but my vet reccomeded a diet (and i agreed).  I looked around at some foods and decided to try avoderm weight control dry kibble.  My dog wouldn't eat it at first, so i tried to mix it in with a higher protein kibble (Premium Edge), but she still wouldn't eat it. I topped it with a little bit of avoderm chicken and rice canned to the mix (1/4 can to 3 cups of dry kibble), and she DEVOURED IT!  After a month of this diet, my dog lost about 3 pounds, her eyes looked bright and she even started romping around again!  I'm SO GLAD I switched to AvoDerm foods!! And so is my Reba!"
13713,13714,B000LRIJ3W,great herring,"this is the closest thing to  going  to norway..great taste, fresh and very satisfying ( if you appreciate pickled herring)..far better than anything available in your local supermarket.."
13715,13716,B004H4NC4Q,Not crazy about this flavor,"I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.<br /><br />The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I won't be buying this flavor again."
13716,13717,B003F8XZSS,Great tea!,"I'm not a huge fan of flavored tea, but the Raspberry Black Tea K-cups are great! My Keurig machine has an iced-tea option, so maybe that is why I am satisfied with my brew each time. I can also use 1 K-cup twice. The second one is weaker, of course, but it's still has a great flavor."
13718,13719,B000AY9U20,Best Cookie...So Full of Chocolate,Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
13737,13738,B0002EQTIG,Fabulous Japanese tea,I searched and searched for a tea that tastes like the tea I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant and I was so happy to discover this brand.  I have turned several friends onto it also.  What I also appreciate is how affordable it is.  Sip and enjoy!
13750,13751,B00408Q8F4,Great Way to Save Money,"Great prices on this product!<br /><br />Prompt shipping and everything was as it should be.<br /><br />This is one of the lowest calorie dressings I have found, and I was very excited to be able to buy it in bulk and save money.<br /><br />Plus the delivery to my house is great!"
13751,13752,B004SNMBAW,so so,"It is not real macha.<br />I'm kinda disappointed with that.<br />I expect that is green, but actually it is dark."
13752,13753,B000UWCZSI,Good - But Not Great. Yet Another Saffron Review,"If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.<br /><br />There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland brand name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra-right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).<br /><br />First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.<br /><br />As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to bring it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier brand of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to ""air out"" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.<br /><br />The actual touch/texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior brands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.<br /><br />Fragrance - very nice and aromatic.<br /><br />Overall - for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon and/or the Roland brand ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only."
13753,13754,B004AW3DQC,Pepsi - F'N Awesome!!,"This is the greatest soda drink on the face of God's green Earth! I've been drinking Pepsi since I was just a little kid. Classic taste. Much better than that garbage called Coke. Anyone who never tasted Pepsi before... Go now and get one! If you have a store near you, buy a case! If you have a vending machine near you, Take a crowbar and open it up! If you see a Pepsi truck driving down the road, attach yourself to the underbelly of that truck. Drill a hole into the truck and crawl up inside it! Then taste the nectar of the Gods that is Pepsi!"
13754,13755,B0024VCX6M,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. Natural. Spicy snack mix also with sweet flavor notes. Americans might find it spicy, but for Indians it is quite mild and more towards the sweet side. If you like Indian flavors and spicy snacks along with some sweetness, you might really enjoy this one! Haldiram is a top snack brand in India. Khatta Meeta is my top favorite Indian snack mix. Made with gram flour, peanut oil, corn oil, peanuts, rice flakes, sago [palm stem starch], sugar, green peas, gram pulse, lentil, salt, mango powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, ginger powder, black pepper powder, & citric acid powder. Was very happy to be able to order from Amazon rather than to wait until I find myself back in India or in a large metro with an Asian market. Walking on the streets in India, you can find the small and big packets of Haldiram snacks nearly everywhere. Halidram's also has one of my favorite sweet shops in Kolkata [Calcutta] near to one of my friend's house and office.  Great for vegan traveling. Approx 1120 calories, 20g protein per bag. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

13762,13763,B0036FBZPK,Labrada Protien drink,"this is very good! I've used GNC products in the past, but I like this one because they have more and different flavors and it leaves me much more full than the GNC stuff. I will buy this from now on."
13766,13767,B001269EX0,Hamming it up,I am very impressed with these country ham slices. A very high quality prooduct greatly exceeds standard racecar driver ham slices from the supermarket. Great flavor not too salty or too sweet.
13767,13768,B001M0ALS8,Gordolobo Tea....,"This tea is very tasty. I drink one cup of hot tea in the morning and at night, with a little honey and equal. Makes me very relaxed and calm."
13768,13769,B0002EQTIQ,SUPER BUY!  HUGE BAG!,"This is a great buy.  We are talking a whole pound, here. And, packaged in individual 2 oz. packets to keep it fresh till you want it.  We have been paying $4 at the store for small 3 ounce bags, so this is a great price as well.  Besides all of that, it's a great tasting product.  One of my best purchases here."
13769,13770,B000BSWIQA,Very disappointed.  This is  a very sweet jelly with an odd texture,"I love lemon marmalade.  They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.<br /><br />I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br />Sugar 62g per 100g<br />Glucose-fructose syrup<br />Lemons<br />Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid<br />Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate<br />Flavoring: Lemon Oil<br />Color:Caramel E150C<br /><br /> Price with shipping slightly over $11.<br /><br />I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!<br /><br />8/22/11 Update<br />Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.<br />Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try."
13772,13773,B0004M29IA,EXCELLENT SOUP MIX,"I absolutely love this soup mix for my roast chicken.  It's the only way I'll roast a chicken.  I actually got the recipe out of my Lipton soup mix cookbook and it's as follows:<br /><br />Country Herb Roasted Chicken<br /><br />1 chicken (2 1/2 to 3 lb.), cut into serving pieces (with or without skin) or 1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast halves<br /><br />1 envelope Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic or Golden Herb with Lemon Soup Mix<br /><br />2 TBS water<br /><br />1 TBS olive or vegetable oil<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br /><br />In a 13x9 baking or roasting pan, arrange chicken.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on chicken.<br /><br />For chicken pieces, bake uncovered 45 minutes or until chicken is done.  For chicken breast halves, bake uncovered 20 minutes or until chicken is done.<br /><br />Makes about 4 servings.<br /><br />I do hope you'll try it.  I had to purchase it from Amazon after all of my local grocery stores discontinued carrying it."
13777,13778,B003R0MFTE,cats love it!,"This is a great product, very fresh and all meat, thank you for such a healthy food for cats who need so much more protein than dogs, no grain fillers-- cats love it!"
13779,13780,B0038K2YNK,Great Tasting!,"I have been trying to maintain my weight for the last six months, and found that substituting my meals with 2 protein shakes helps me do just that. I enjoy drinking hot drinks because it allows me to savor them longer. I was very skeptical that this would taste awful, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't imagine drinking regular hot cocoa again now that I've found one that is actually good for me!"
13784,13785,B0017U7TFG,Glad to find lower sodium products,"I've tried most of the McDougall LIGHT SODIUM instant soups and have them several times each week for lunch.  White Bean and Pasta is my second favorite LIGHT SODIUM soup behind the Split Pea (really like that one).<br /><br />It does, however, require more time than the other soups to ""steep"" and develop its flavors.  It also requires more time to take the crunch out of the pasta and vegetables.  Let it sit longer than directed and you may want to put it back in the microwave to heat up.<br /><br />Small price to pay for an inexpensive and relatively healthy lunch.  Try it."
13806,13807,B000FFIIYU,Daneille (non celiac that cooks for 3 celiacs),I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.
13808,13809,B0008D6XH8,DELISH and great for cooking,"I use the lemon and orange in a lot of things; esp iced tea. And orange in rice, oatmeal, other things to cut calories. One drop and delish!"
13811,13812,B004GPB8SI,Awesome Stuff,I really like this cocoa butter. It makes excellent chocolates! I would definately order again. Good quality. Shipped quickly. Very happy overall.
13812,13813,B000UODYHW,"Great tea, horrible packaging","The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea, I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip, and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me, I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box, but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes, go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea."
13813,13814,B004KPXU8U,pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea,Very pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea but found it to have disappointedly weak rose flavor as a tea itself.<br />Perhaps the other rose teas I've had were infused with flavoring. Not sure.
13814,13815,B0000D9N35,Unique Spanish Cheese,"Outstanding cheese with some personality.  Grates well for pasta, potatoes, omelettes.  Wine - while fine with some Spanish (and other) reds, this cheese is especially tasty with a peary Sauv Blanc."
13815,13816,B0051SZD0S,LA VICTORIA GREEN TACO SAUCE,"THIS IS ""GREEN GOLD""; I DISCOVERED IT WHILE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND ALWAYS KEPT IT IN THE KITCHEN; IT'S NOT SOLD DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH THAT I KNOW OF; IT'S TASTY ON SO MANY FOODS; IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE DELICIOUS GUILTY FOODS EITHER."
13817,13818,B004OT0WRY,Canine Caviar,"My dogs are use to chicken jerky. They were apprehensive at 1st. I kept the buffalo put away for awhile, now they seem to love it. Go figure? Anyway it last longer than chicken jerky. I give them both alternataly. No jerky made in China, be careful of that."
13818,13819,B004TEVGHO,Very Good Drink with a Minimum of Calories.,"I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water, I choose an ice-cold slightly carbonated spring  water. Just mix and, viola, a nice tasting glass of fruit drink with a minimum of calories. Delicious! Very, very good. And the original bottle says it has 22 servings, although I may make up a little larger serving than they suggest. Well, what can I say? It tastes like a very good soda pop and has an absolute minimum of calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
13819,13820,B000E1BKRC,Oven Fry,"I have a weakness for good fried fish and as I age, I've cut down on my fried foods.  No, this is not as good as deep fried fish but it is a darn good substitute.  I cut the fish in small pieces dip them in egg and bread them with Oven Fry.  I cover my cookie sheet with foil, so there are no dishes to wash.  I also put oven fried potatoes in at about the same time.  Then I make a salad to compromise toward a more healthy meal.  It's quick, easy and fairly healthy.  No it's not diet food but it doesn't taste like diet food either.  I just bought a case of Oven Fry from Amazon and am a repeat customer. It has become more and more difficult to find their fish product in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon when these supermarkets quit carrying the products I enjoy."
13821,13822,B006TGZT78,damage product,I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse.
13822,13823,B0080HFENI,Fun to try all five flavors,"The Crunchmaster brand is definitely my favorite brand of gluten free crackers. Previously, I had only tried the white cheddar and regular multi-grain so I was excited about a variety pack. My favorites were the white cheddar and garden vegetable (these two are square in shape and less grainy). The other flavors (rosemary & olive oil, roasted garlic and toasted onion) were octagonal shape and have a nuttier consistency. I liked all of them though the octagonal shaped flavors were best with toppings, while the squares were better on their own."
13824,13825,B007GEKOGI,I'll order again :),"Tea tastes wonderful! No weird ""fishy"" smell, or ""muddy"" taste like some have said about other suppliers. Individually wrapped 100 tea bags.<br /><br />Shipping: Product came fast and in great condition."
13829,13830,B004WJUXCK,canada wintergreen mints,Exactly as I remembered as a child (50 years ago) and my mother and great nephew love this candy. I didn't have to wait long to receive the mints (8 pounds). great purchase.<br />thanks
13830,13831,B0043H37EW,Love Tic Tacs,These are hard to find flavor..My husband loves these....rec'd order fast & product was perfect....2nd time ordering and will continue ...My husband eats these like candy....don't know if thats good or bad... but I do know he loves them and his breath always smells great !
13834,13835,B002KE33QC,Dog Treats,Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
13839,13840,B000NGRUQ8,Black Pearls,I was introduced to Taj Mahal by an Indian women who used it as the base for a wonderfully flavored chai using mostly ginger and cardamom.  I have been a fan ever since.  It is strong - only for strong black tea drinkers.
13843,13844,B002O5QWD8,Love them!,"I like crunchy snacks.  I'm eating low carb because my doctor advises it, and this helps fill the ""popcorn spot"" in my life.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about this product.  It's economical.  They cook up fresh whenever you want them, and they taste fresher than the ones you buy pre-popped in a bag.  They don't have MSG like the Lawry's brand, and they don't come with a lot of extra packaging.<br /><br />If you are a low carber looking for pork rinds to cook with, these aren't heavily seasoned, so they won't influence your recipe's flavor.  I like their clean flavor, but it's not hard to add seasoning if you want to experiment or you like more variety.  A little bit of oil or butter will serve as the ""glue"" to hold your Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, etc.<br /><br />There is a bit of a learning curve involved in terms of discovering how long they take in your microwave, but by now I know by feel what size handful to grab and how long to nuke them. It's worth the effort to get to know these.  Highly recommended!"
13872,13873,B003WZXTY4,Marionberry Jam,I purchased this jam for gifts for Christmas. Everyone loved the jam and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you so very much.
13874,13875,B003DA5536,"Bad, Old, Products...","This product that I recieved was old... My dogs turned their nose up at it... My dogs really love this when they are fresh... These must have been over 1 yr old... I can't believe that Amazon had sold these... Bad, Old, Products..."
13878,13879,B002Q7AR3U,Pointless,"I purchased this product based on the great reviews, with one reviewer even saying that it's perfect for stuffing bleu cheese olives.  Great!  That's what I wanted it for.  I figured I'd be able to load this thing up with cheese and fill the olives quickly.  It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.  It just doubles the time it would take you to get your olives ready.  If they could make one of these with a big chamber that could hold lots of cheese, we'd be in business!"
13886,13887,B005DX8YJS,pie making with sweet rice flour,"I made excellent pie crust with Mochiko sweet rice flour, which was recommended by a recipe I had.  The crust was tender, moist and flaky.  It was so tender that it broke easily, but I was able to manage it by rolling it out on plastic wrap.  And the taste was to die for!"
13889,13890,B001A01BN4,No results,"Purchased this as an experiment to see what the effects would be.  Nothing happened.  Don't know if that's due to something specific about this company's product, or whether any sceletium tortuosum would have had no effect.  For the price it was worth experimenting, but a downer when nothing happens."
13890,13891,B0002FGY9O,FANTASTIC!,"This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked -- roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!<br /><br />Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so."
13892,13893,B000NQA2R2,Best golden flax,I really like this kind of flax seed. I've been eating flax seed with my meals for 2 years and this is the best I've stumbled upon
13895,13896,B001G2F5R4,High Cost,"I purchased 2 containers of this product because I thought I was getting a terrific bargain.  Not so.  I later found the product- same coffee- same weight, for $13.49 per container at Sam's Club.  Needless to say, I won't be ordering this again from Amazon!  Coffee is great-price is not.  Too bad, because I purchase a lot of items from Amazon.  But never again, this one."
13901,13902,B002KE92UI,So good I only got one taste,"I bought a small bottle in Chapel Hill, NC, but didn't pop it open for a taste until I got to VA.  Big mistake!  It was so good and it was too late to backtrack.  Then my 3 young men got hold of it.  All gone.<br />It's hard to believe how flavorful this sauce is.  The sweet potatoes and peppers give it a rich potency that is worthy of a thousand recipes.  I love hot  sauce, but I would gladly use this in foods for people who don't share that taste.<br />Cackalacky is a place where all tongues may come together in mutual celebration."
13903,13904,B003P9WUAG,BEST baby cat food !!! (Or elder),"I rescued a VERY VERY sick kitten (nearly died) and after he was well, he was still not interested in eating - until I found this.  This is not only very high quality & full of important nutrients, protein, fat, etc., but he LOVES it.  Since starting on his babycat, he is gaining weight & feeling MUCH better !  *WHEW !*  Note also that the 'kitten' formula of this is mostly the same but is little chunks - I mashed them, but its not the same as the pureed babycat !"
13908,13909,B002OFZIV0,If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...,"UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road."
13957,13958,B000BHREYW,"hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options","My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver"".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken ""by-products""-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide."
13958,13959,B007N68CC2,Delicious and at a great price,"These syrups for Sno Cones are delicious. Our family loves them, we had also purchased a pack of the Hawaiian Ice syrups and we prefer these (and they are cheaper). A very good deal. I will be buying more soon."
13968,13969,B000793XK8,Inferior product,"The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect."
